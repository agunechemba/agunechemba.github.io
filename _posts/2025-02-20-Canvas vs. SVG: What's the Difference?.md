When creating graphics on the web, you’ll often choose between **Canvas** and **SVG**. They both draw visuals—but in very different ways.

### 🎨 What is Canvas?

* **Pixel-based**
* Uses the `<canvas>` element
* You draw with JavaScript
* Once drawn, shapes are fixed and not easily interactive

**Best for:**

* Games
* Animations
* Large, fast visual updates (like data graphs)

---

### ✏️ What is SVG?

* **Vector-based**
* Uses the `<svg>` element
* Shapes (like circles, lines, etc.) are defined with code
* Each shape is a DOM element—easy to style, animate, and interact with

**Best for:**

* Icons
* Diagrams
* Interactive UI graphics

### 🔍 Key Differences

1. **Scalability**

   * **SVG** scales perfectly on all screen sizes
   * **Canvas** may become blurry when resized

2. **Interactivity**

   * **SVG** elements can be styled or clicked directly
   * **Canvas** needs extra code to make shapes interactive

3. **Performance**

   * **Canvas** is faster for complex, frequent updates
   * **SVG** handles simpler visuals more efficiently

---

### ✅ Quick Rule of Thumb

* Use **Canvas** for speed and real-time updates
* Use **SVG** for clarity and interaction
