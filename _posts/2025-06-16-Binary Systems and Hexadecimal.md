# Binary Systems and Hexadecimal: How Computers Control Machines

Computers may look incredibly smart, but deep down, they only understand **two signals**: **ON** or **OFF** ‚Äî represented as **1** and **0**. Every digital operation, from playing a song to steering a robot, comes down to switching between these two states.

A **bit** (short for *binary digit*) is the smallest piece of information in a computer system. You can imagine a bit as a tiny lightbulb or switch that can be **ON (1)** or **OFF (0)**. It‚Äôs the fundamental building block of all computer logic.

A group of bits working together forms a **register** ‚Äî a small storage box inside the processor that temporarily holds and controls data. You can think of a register as a miniature **control panel** filled with switches. If it‚Äôs an **8-bit register**, then it has **eight little switches**, each representing one bit. Flipping a switch to 1 turns it ‚Äúon‚Äù; setting it to 0 turns it ‚Äúoff.‚Äù By combining these switches in different ways, the processor can send instructions to different parts of a system.

## Robbie, the Robot Vacuum

Now, imagine a small robot vacuum named **Robbie**. Robbie moves around the room on three wheels: **A**, **B**, and **C**.

* **Wheel A** helps him steer.
* **Wheel B** and **Wheel C** drive him forward or backward, each powered by its own motor.

Inside Robbie‚Äôs tiny ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is an **8-bit register** that controls these motors. Each bit in that register has a specific purpose, as follows:

* **Bit 1:** Turn **Motor B (left wheel)** ON
* **Bit 2:** Turn **Motor B** OFF
* **Bit 3:** Turn **Motor C (right wheel)** ON
* **Bit 4:** Turn **Motor C** OFF
* **Bit 5:** Set **Wheel B** direction to FORWARD
* **Bit 6:** Set **Wheel B** direction to BACKWARD
* **Bit 7:** Set **Wheel C** direction to FORWARD
* **Bit 8:** Set **Wheel C** direction to BACKWARD

If you flip a bit to **1**, you activate that control. A **0** turns it off.

For example:

* If **Bit 1 = 1**, Motor B turns **ON**.
* If **Bit 5 = 1**, Wheel B moves **FORWARD**.

Now, if the entire register reads `10101010`, the meaning becomes clear:

* **Bits 1, 3, 5, and 7** are all set to 1.
* This means **both motors (B and C)** are **ON** and both wheels are **moving forward**.
  So, Robbie rolls straight ahead!

Changing any bit‚Äôs value instantly changes Robbie‚Äôs behavior. Turning a bit from 1 to 0 can stop a motor, reverse a wheel, or make him turn. This is exactly how digital machines ‚Äúthink‚Äù and ‚Äúact‚Äù ‚Äî one bit at a time.

## The Power Behind the Switches

At the heart of every processor are **transistors**, the microscopic electronic switches that make up bits. Modern chips contain **millions or even billions** of these transistors. Each one can allow or block the flow of electricity ‚Äî representing a **1** or **0**.

By rapidly turning combinations of these switches on and off, computers perform calculations, run programs, display graphics, and control robots like Robbie. Every modern device ‚Äî from phones to satellites ‚Äî operates on this same simple binary logic.
