Growing up in Lagos, I was lucky to attend **Meu Victory Comprehensive College**, Ona-ara Street, Idimu — a school that actually had computers in the lab, back when most Nigerian schools taught computer studies on a blackboard.

In the early 2000s, I got my first email on **Yahoo** (yeah, before Gmail was even popular) and spent hours on **Yahoo Messenger** chatting with friends using slang like **“asl”** — age, sex, location. Simple times, but those little things got me hooked on tech.

## From Arts to Tech Hustle

I was more into arts back then, and **Literature** was my favorite subject. But everything changed in SS2 when I got my first laptop — a **Toshiba with just 512MB RAM**. The internet was slow and expensive through a **Visafone landline** modem, but I used that setup to do some graphics work and mess around with basic **HTML and CSS**. That was the start of my tech hustle.

## Leveling Up: Photoshop and Web Dev

Fast forward to 2010, while studying at **Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri**, I upgraded the RAM of my now 8-year-old laptop and learned **Photoshop** from a photographer called *Award Photos*. Editing pictures for my websites gave me mad skills and confidence.

During one holiday in Lagos, a friend introduced me to a private instructor who ran tutorials around **Egbeda**. That’s where I really boosted my web development skills and fell even deeper in love with tech.

## Teaching Journey: From Literature to ICT

I started teaching **Literature** at **DHFIS, Lagos**, but soon switched to teaching **ICT**. I introduced ICT as a subject and made sure to include practical lessons. My students loved it, probably because I was good at explaining stuff thanks to my **Communication** studies.

Later, I went back to school for another degree in **software development** to up my game.

## Today: Building, Training, and Leading

Nowadays, I’m the brain behind **Pepe Programming Hub**; in the past, I did **Firstac Academy** and **AfroDiscourse**. I host coding competitions and build and manage websites and IT systems, but **training remains my true passion**.

I use my projects — big and small — mostly to train and inspire learners from all over. Watching others grow in tech through my training is what keeps me going.

## Scaling Up: Training, Impact, and Big Dreams

Today, I’m proud to be a success in the **tech-ed** business, training over a hundred learners both online and face-to-face. Looking ahead, I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate with bigger personalities and brands like Brendan Eich, Google, Microsoft, and MIT to make an even greater impact.

## What I Want My Learners to Know

Teachers might not always show you the path to crazy success, but they teach you **how not to fail**. They give you the foundation to stand on.

**Keep grinding. Keep building. Remember where you started.**
