Growing up in Lagos 🇳🇬, I was lucky 🍀 to attend **Meu Victory Comprehensive College**, Ona-ara Street, Idimu — a school that actually had computers 🖥️ in the lab, back when most Nigerian schools were teaching computer studies on the blackboard 🧑🏽‍🏫📝.

In the early 2000s, I got my first email on **Yahoo** 📧 (yeah, before Gmail was even popular 😅) and spent hours on **Yahoo Messenger** 💬 chatting with friends using slang like **“asl”** — age, sex, location. Simple times 😌 but those little things got me hooked on tech. 💙

## From Arts to Tech Hustle 🎨➡️💻

I was more into arts 🎭 back then, and **Literature** 📚 was my favorite subject. But everything changed in SS2 when I got my first laptop — a **Toshiba with just 512MB RAM** 💾. The internet was slow 🐢 and expensive 💸 through a **Visafone landline** modem ☎️, but I used that setup to do some graphics work 🎨 and mess around with basic **HTML and CSS** 💻. That was the start of my tech hustle 🚀.

## Leveling Up: Photoshop and Web Dev 🖌️🧑🏽‍💻

Fast forward to 2010 ⏩, while studying at **Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri** 🎓, I upgraded the RAM of my now 8-year-old laptop 💪 and learned **Photoshop** 🖼️ from a photographer called *Award Photos*. Editing pictures for my websites gave me mad skills 😎 and confidence 💥.

During one holiday in Lagos ☀️, a friend introduced me to a private instructor who ran tutorials around **Egbeda** 📍. That’s where I really boosted my web dev skills 💻🚀 and fell even deeper in love with tech 💘.

## Teaching Journey: From Literature to ICT 🧑🏽‍🏫➡️💡

I started teaching **Literature** at **DHFIS, Lagos** ✍️, but soon switched to **ICT** 🔌. I introduced ICT as a subject and made sure to include practical lessons ⚙️. My students loved it ❤️, probably because I was good at explaining stuff thanks to my **Communication** studies 🗣️.

Later, I went back to school for another degree in **software development** 👨🏽‍🎓 to up my game 🎮.

## Today: Building, Training, and Leading 🔧📚🚀

Nowadays, I’m the brain 🧠 behind **Pepe Programming Hub** 🐸; in the past, I did **Firstac Academy** 🎓 and **AfroDiscourse** 🗣️. I host coding competitions 🏆👩🏽‍💻 and build/manage websites and IT systems 🌐 — but **training remains my true passion** 💯.

I use my projects — big and small — mostly to train and inspire learners from all over 🌍. Watching others grow in tech through my training is what keeps me going 💡✨.

## Scaling Up: Training, Impact, and Big Dreams 📈🌟

Today, I’m proud to be a success in the **tech-ed** business 💼💻, training over a hundred learners both online 🌐 and face-to-face 👥. Looking ahead 👀, I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate with big personalities and brands like **Brendan Eich**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, and **MIT** 🤝💼 to make an even greater impact 💥.

## What I Want My Learners to Know 🧠👶🏽

Teachers might not always show you the path to crazy success 🚀, but they teach you **how not to fail** 🛡️. They give you the foundation to stand on 🧱.

**Keep grinding ⚒️. Keep building 🏗️. Remember where you started 🛤️.**
