# 🧭 Pyhton Operator Overloading: When Python Gives “superpowers” To Your Objects!

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/operator-overloading.jpg" width="100%">

Let’s start with something simple.

You already know what the **“+”** sign does, right?
When you write:

```python
print(5 + 10)
```

Python adds the two numbers and gives `15`.
Easy-peasy!

Now, look at this:

```python
print("Hello " + "World")
```

Python **joins the two words** and gives:

```
Hello World
```

Wait a second! 🤔
How did “+” add numbers *and also* join words?
Isn’t that the same operator?

Yes! But Python is *smart.*
It knows that `+` means addition for numbers, and joining for strings.

That’s what we call **operator overloading** —

> When the same operator behaves differently depending on the type of data it’s working with.

### 🧩 The Secret Behind It

Every operator in Python (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `<`, etc.) actually calls a **special hidden method** behind the scenes.

Let’s reveal the magic.

When you write:

```python
5 + 10
```

Python secretly does this:

```python
(5).__add__(10)
```

When you write:

```python
"Hello " + "World"
```

Python actually calls:

```python
"Hello ".__add__("World")
```

Each data type defines *how* it wants to behave with that operator.

And the coolest part?
You can teach **your own classes** how to behave with those operators too! 💪

That’s called **operator overloading** — giving your class objects custom powers to use normal math symbols in cool ways.

### 🐍 Example: Adding Two Objects

Let’s say we create a simple class to represent **points** on a graph.

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

Now we create two points:

```python
p1 = Point(2, 3)
p2 = Point(4, 5)
```

What if we try to add them?

```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

💥 Python gets confused!
It will say something like:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
```

Why?
Because Python doesn’t know how to **add two Point objects** — unless we teach it how.

---

### 🧠 Giving It Power — The `__add__` Method

Let’s define what the `+` should do for our `Point` objects.

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

Now let’s try again:

```python
p1 = Point(2, 3)
p2 = Point(4, 5)
print(p1 + p2)
```

Output:

```
(6, 8)
```

🎉 It works!
The `+` operator now **adds the coordinates** of the two points and gives us a *new Point*.

We’ve just **overloaded the + operator** — gave it new meaning for our own objects!

### 🧮 Other Common Overloaded Operators

Python lets you overload many operators by defining their “magic methods” — methods with double underscores (also called *dunder methods*).

| Operator | Magic Method  | Example Usage             |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `+`      | `__add__`     | `a + b`                   |
| `-`      | `__sub__`     | `a - b`                   |
| `*`      | `__mul__`     | `a * b`                   |
| `/`      | `__truediv__` | `a / b`                   |
| `==`     | `__eq__`      | `a == b`                  |
| `<`      | `__lt__`      | `a < b`                   |
| `>`      | `__gt__`      | `a > b`                   |
| `str()`  | `__str__`     | Converts object to string |

Let’s make another example to see this in action.

### 🧩 Example: Comparing Two Boxes by Weight

Imagine two boxes with different weights:

```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, weight):
        self.weight = weight

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.weight < other.weight

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Box({self.weight}kg)"
```

Now:

```python
b1 = Box(10)
b2 = Box(20)

print(b1 < b2)
```

Output:

```
True
```

Python used our custom `__lt__` (less than) method!
So `b1 < b2` means `10 < 20` — and it’s *true*.

---

### ⚙️ Why It’s So Useful

Operator overloading lets you:

✅ Make your classes act like built-in data types

✅ Write cleaner, more intuitive code

✅ Express mathematical or logical relationships naturally

Instead of writing:

```python
Point.add_points(p1, p2)
```

you simply write:

```python
p1 + p2
```

Much more natural, right?

---

### 🧠 Remember This

1. Every operator calls a *special method* (like `__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.)
2. You can redefine those methods inside your class.
3. You decide what happens when that operator is used.
4. It makes your objects smarter, flexible, and more human-like to code with.

| `*`      | `__mul__()`     | Multiplies two objects             |
| `/`      | `__truediv__()` | Divides two objects                |
| `==`     | `__eq__()`      | Checks equality                    |
| `<`      | `__lt__()`      | Checks if one object is smaller    |
| `str()`  | `__str__()`     | Converts object to readable string |
