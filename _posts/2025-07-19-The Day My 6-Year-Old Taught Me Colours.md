It started with a dress.
Not a lecture. Not a classroom session.
Just a **simple father-daughter moment**.

That morning, I was chatting with my daughter—my **third child out of four beautiful children I have today**. She stood there in her little dress, full of confidence and calm. I looked at her outfit, smiled, and said:

> “This red dress looks so nice on you.”

She didn’t flinch. Just tilted her head, looked up at me with those honest eyes, and said:

> **“Daddy… it’s pink.”**

I blinked. *Pink ke?*
Wasn’t it red?
But the way she said it, with boldness and assurance—it made me pause. And that pause opened the door to something unexpectedly amazing.

## 🌈 The Colour Challenge Begins

Naturally, I had to “test” her. 😄
I started pointing to objects around the room: books, toys, wrappers, baskets, even clothes on the line.

She named them *all*.

> *“That’s teal.”*

> *“This is peach.”*

> *“Daddy, that’s not yellow—it’s mustard!”*

At some point, I honestly couldn’t argue anymore.
I brought out **Google Lens** just to double-check the colours *she* was confidently naming.

Can you imagine? A tech dad—**me**—getting schooled by my 6-year-old in colour recognition.

## 🪴 Back to the Garden — Our First Colour Lessons

As I laughed and marveled at how much she knew, a memory flashed back from when she was just **three years old**.

We were in my small garden, picking up unwanted trash—nylons, cottons, little bits of paper that had no business being around plants and soil. I was holding the basket while she picked things up one by one.

Then I tried to turn it into a game: I pointed with my stick and called out colours.

> *“Pick up that red nylon.”*

> *“Get that white one there.”*

> *“Now the black wrapper near the leaf.”*

She followed every single instruction.

It was a little moment back then… but now, I realize we were laying the foundation. **That garden was her first colour classroom.** And I was her very first art teacher—without even knowing it.

## 👨🏽‍🎓 Tables Turned: Now She’s Teaching Me

Fast forward three years, and she’s no longer the student.
**She’s the expert.**
I’m just the guy holding the stick. 😅

And honestly? I don’t feel bad.

In fact, I feel **proud**.

It means she’s observant. She’s confident. She’s growing. And somewhere along the line, I must’ve done something right.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Sometimes, parenting doesn’t come with grand speeches or fancy gadgets.
Sometimes, it comes in **tiny hands holding trash**, or **bold voices correcting you with “Daddy, it’s pink.”**
