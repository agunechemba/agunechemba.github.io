# JavaScript WeakMap: Your VIP Secret Notebook

Think of a **secret notebook** where you can write notes about people, but you don’t keep their real names—just **references to them** (like pointing at them).
If the person disappears (no one is referencing them), their note **magically disappears from your notebook too**.
That’s what a **WeakMap** does in JavaScript.

### **What is a WeakMap?**

A **WeakMap** is like a Map (a collection of key-value pairs), but:

* The **keys must be objects** (not strings or numbers).
* If the object is gone (no one references it), the WeakMap entry disappears automatically.

This means the data **doesn’t cause memory leaks** because JavaScript cleans it up for you when the object is no longer used.

---

### **Why is it called "Weak"?**

Because the **keys are weakly referenced**—JavaScript doesn’t prevent them from being removed by the garbage collector.
In a normal Map, if you store an object as a key, it stays forever unless you delete it.
In a WeakMap, if the object disappears, the entry disappears too.

---

### **Example**

```
let secretInfo = new WeakMap();

let user = { name: "Alice" };

secretInfo.set(user, "Likes pizza");

console.log(secretInfo.get(user)); // Likes pizza

user = null; // Remove reference to the object
// Now WeakMap entry is gone automatically!
```

Here:

* We associate `"Likes pizza"` with `user`.
* When `user` is set to `null`, the WeakMap automatically deletes the data.

---

### **What can you do with WeakMap?**

* `.set(key, value)` → Add a value for a key.
* `.get(key)` → Get the value for a key.
* `.has(key)` → Check if key exists.
* `.delete(key)` → Remove key-value pair.

---

### **Where is it useful?**

* Storing **private data** for objects.
* Attaching **metadata** to DOM elements without causing memory leaks.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of a **VIP list at a secret club**, where:

* People (objects) can enter the club and have special info (values).
* If someone leaves forever, their name is removed automatically.
* You can’t see the full list, only check if someone is on it.

---

### **In Short**

* WeakMap = **Map for objects only, with automatic cleanup**.
* Prevents memory leaks.
* Keys are **weakly held**, so they disappear when the object is gone.

#### **Review Questions**

1. A WeakMap stores data as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ pairs.
2. The keys in a WeakMap must be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. If the object key is no longer referenced, the entry in WeakMap \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. WeakMap helps prevent \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ leaks.
5. To add a value in WeakMap, we use the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ method.
6. To retrieve a value, we use the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ method.
7. To check if a key exists in WeakMap, we use the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ method.
8. WeakMap is useful for storing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ data for objects.
9. A real-life analogy for WeakMap is a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ list at a secret club.
10. Unlike a normal Map, WeakMap does not prevent the object from being \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ collected.
