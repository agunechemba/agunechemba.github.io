# 🚦 JavaScript Strict Mode: The Strict School Principal 🎓

Imagine your classroom is JavaScript. On normal days, students (your code) can sometimes be careless:

* They forget to put their names on assignments.
* They write on the desk.
* They break little rules and still get away with it.

But then... **the strict principal walks in!** 😤
Suddenly, everyone must follow the rules exactly. No sloppiness allowed!

That’s what **strict mode** is in JavaScript.

## 🤖 What Is Strict Mode?

**Strict mode** is a way to tell JavaScript:

> “Hey! Be extra careful when running this code.”

It helps catch mistakes, stop bad behavior, and make your code more secure and cleaner.

---

## 🔧 How to Turn on Strict Mode

All you need to do is add this at the top of your code:

```
"use strict";
```

Here’s an example:

```
"use strict";

x = 10; // ❌ Error: x is not declared
```

Without `"use strict";`, JavaScript would quietly let it slide.

With strict mode, it says: “NOPE! You must declare `x` first with `let`, `const`, or `var`.”

---

## 🛡️ What Does Strict Mode Help With?

Here are some superpowers strict mode gives you:

---

### 1. ❌ No Using Undeclared Variables

```
"use strict";
myName = "Ekene"; // ❌ Error!
```

You must use `let`, `const`, or `var`:

```
"use strict";
let myName = "Ekene"; // ✅ Okay!
```

---

### 2. ❌ Stops You from Using Reserved Words

You can’t name a variable something like `let`, `class`, or `interface`:

```
"use strict";
let let = 5; // ❌ Error!
```

Strict mode protects future JavaScript features.

---

### 3. ❌ No Duplicate Parameter Names

This would cause confusion:

```
"use strict";
function sayHi(name, name) {
  console.log(name);
}
// ❌ Error!
```

---

### 4. 🔒 Makes Your Code Safer and Cleaner

It helps you avoid sneaky bugs and makes your code easier to understand and fix.

---

## 🧪 Example Without and With Strict Mode

🔴 Without `"use strict"`:

```
myAge = 13; // JavaScript just assumes it's a new variable
console.log(myAge);
```

🟢 With `"use strict"`:

```
"use strict";
myAge = 13; // ❌ Error: You forgot to declare it
```

This helps catch mistakes early before they grow into hard-to-find bugs!

---

## 👨🏽‍🏫 Why Should You Use It?

Strict mode is like having a strict but wise teacher. They might not let you bend the rules, but in the end, **you learn better** and **become a pro** faster!

That’s why experienced coders often say:

> “Start every file with `"use strict";`—especially when you're still learning.”

## ✅ Review and Practice Questions

1. **What does `"use strict";` do in JavaScript?**
2. **Why is using undeclared variables a bad idea?**
3. **What will this code do?**

   ```
   "use strict";
   score = 100;
   ```
4. **Write a correct version of the above code that works in strict mode.**
5. **What happens if you try to use `let` as a variable name in strict mode?**
