## 🏗️ Step 1: Creating the `Cat` Class

Let’s say you want to create a cat in your program. Not just any cat—a cat with a name, an age, and the ability to say *meow*. You do this using a **Python class**.

Here’s the basic code:

```
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def meow(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Meowww! 🐾")
```

Let’s break it down:

* `class Cat:` — This defines a new class named `Cat`.
* `__init__` — This is the **constructor method**, which is automatically called when you create a new `Cat` object.
* `self.name` and `self.age` — These are **attributes** that store the cat’s name and age.
* `meow()` — This method prints a message that includes the cat’s name.

## 🐱 Step 2: Creating and Using the Cat Object

Once you have the class, you can create a cat:

```
my_cat = Cat("Luna", 3)
my_cat.meow()
```

When you run this code, Luna introduces herself:

```
Luna says Meowww! 🐾
```

## 🧠 Step 3: Understanding the Mysterious `f` in `f"{self.name}"`

Now here comes the magic part: What does that `f` before the string mean?

```
print(f"{self.name} says Meowww! 🐾")
```

That `f` stands for **formatted string literal**, or simply **f-string**.

It allows you to **insert variables directly into a string** using curly braces `{}`.

### 🎉 Example:

```
name = "Whiskers"
age = 2
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

**Output:**

```
Whiskers is 2 years old.
```

You can even do math inside the curly braces!

```
print(f"{name} will be {age + 1} next year.")
```

**Output:**

```
Whiskers will be 3 next year.
```

## 🧪 Step 4: Add More Personality to Your Cat

Want your cat to do more? Try this:

```
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def meow(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Meowww! 🐾")

    def describe(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
```

Now you can call:

```
my_cat.describe()
```

**Output:**

```
My name is Luna and I am 3 years old.
```

## 📝 Practice and Review Questions

1. What does the `__init__` method do in a Python class?
2. Rewrite the `Cat` class to include a `purr()` method that prints a purring sound.
3. What does the `f` in `f-string` stand for, and what is it used for?
4. How do you create and use a new `Cat` object named "Oreo" who is 4 years old?
5. How would you change the `meow()` method so that it prints louder meows for older cats (age > 5)?
