### ❄️ A Cold Morning, A Hot Idea

It was a cold day in 1953 when **John Backus** stepped into IBM's New York office. The IBM 701 stood there — a beast of a machine with blinking lights, tangled wires, and vacuum tubes. Backus, a rising computer scientist, had one mission:

> **Make programming easier for everyone.**

---

### 💡 The Crazy Vision

At the time, programming meant writing in *machine language* — numbers and codes that only a few could understand. Backus dreamed of a language humans could read and write easily, one that a *compiler* would translate for the machine.

Most people said:

> “It’s impossible.”

Backus replied:

> “Let’s build it anyway.”

### 🛠️ The Dream Team

He pulled together a brilliant crew:

* **Sheldon Best**
* **Lois Mitchell**
* **Irving Ziller**

Together, they built something revolutionary:
**Speedcoding** — the very first compiler for the IBM 701.

### ⚙️ Challenges, Bugs & Breakthroughs

The IBM 701 had limited memory and processing power. Debugging was a nightmare. But with grit and vision, they cracked it. Speedcoding turned high-level math-like code into machine language — blazing fast.

It worked. And it changed everything.

---

### 🚀 From Speedcoding to Fortran

Inspired by Speedcoding’s success, Backus and his team created **Fortran** — short for *Formula Translation*.

* Easy to learn.
* Perfect for scientists and engineers.
* Widely adopted.

It became the world's first popular high-level language.

### 👑 Backus's Legacy

John Backus didn’t just invent a tool. He sparked a revolution.

Thanks to him:

* Programming became human-friendly.
* Software development accelerated.
* Modern languages (like Python, Java, and C++) became possible.
