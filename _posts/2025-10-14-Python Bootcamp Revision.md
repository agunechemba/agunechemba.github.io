Welcome back, Python learners! 🎉

This page serves as your **official revision index** for the **August Python Bootcamp**.

## 🚀 Bootcamp Summary

## 1 [Python Data Types](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/05/10/Python-Data-Types.html)

Everything in Python is built from **data types** — they’re the foundation of every variable you create.
This lesson explores:

* Numbers (`int`, `float`, `complex`)
* Text (`str`)
* Collections (`list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`)
* And the logical type `bool`

It’s where we began understanding *how Python stores and interprets information.*

## 2 [Python Control Statements](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/05/29/Python-Control-Statements.html)

Logic gives your program direction.
This lesson shows how to **control the flow** of your code with:

* `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Nested conditions
* Conditional expressions

By mastering control statements, you learned how your program “decides” what to do next.

---

## 3 [Python Functions](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/06/12/Python-Functions.html)

Functions are like little machines in your code — they take input, perform a task, and return a result.
Here we covered:

* Defining functions with `def`
* Parameters vs. arguments
* Return values and scope
* Default parameters and keyword arguments

This lesson taught you how to **organize your code logically** and avoid repetition.

## 4 [Python Block Project — Guess the Number Game](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/08/05/Python-Block-Project.html)

Time to apply your new skills!
This beginner project used control flow and loops to create a fun guessing game.
You practiced:

* Random number generation
* Input validation
* Loops with conditions
* Basic feedback messages

It was your first taste of turning logic into an *interactive* experience.

---

## 5 [Python Beginner Project — Simple Calculator](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/08/06/Python-Beginner-Project.html)

Next, we built a calculator — a practical project combining everything you had learned.
The lesson reinforced:

* Input handling and conversion
* Arithmetic operations
* Conditional error checks (like division by zero)
* Function-based design

This helped you see how even simple programs can be neatly structured and user-friendly.

---

## 6 [Python Intermediate Project — Number Guessing (with Limited Tries)](https://agunechemba.name.ng/2025/08/07/Python-Intermediate-Project.html)

Your final challenge took the earlier guessing game to the next level.
You added:

* Maximum attempt limits
* Try/except for input errors
* Replay loops
* Function reuse

It was a demonstration of **problem-solving, user experience design, and modular thinking.**
