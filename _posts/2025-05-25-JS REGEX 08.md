# JS REGEX 08: Mastering Special RegEx Tricks: Captures, Groups and Peeks

As you progress in mastering Regular Expressions (RegEx), you’ll discover that simple matching is not enough.
Sometimes you need to **capture**, **group**, or **look ahead** within your string. JavaScript provides powerful constructs for this purpose:

* **Capturing Groups** – used to extract and reuse matched parts.
* **Non-Capturing Groups** – used for logical grouping without storing matches.
* **Look-Aheads** – used to verify conditions that follow a match without consuming characters.

These concepts allow fine-grained control over pattern recognition, text extraction, and validation.

## 1️⃣ Capturing Groups `( )`

**Capturing groups** are created using parentheses `( )`.
They allow you to match a portion of text and store it as a **submatch** within the overall pattern.
Captured data can later be referenced in code or reused during replacements.

### Syntax:

```regex
(pattern)
```

### Example:

```js
"John Doe".match(/(John) (Doe)/);
```

**Result:**

* `match[0]` → `"John Doe"` (entire match)
* `match[1]` → `"John"` (first captured group)
* `match[2]` → `"Doe"` (second captured group)

Capturing groups are particularly useful when you need to extract structured information like names, numbers, or codes.

### Referencing Captured Groups

Captured groups can be referenced during replacement using `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

```js
"John Doe".replace(/(John) (Doe)/, "$2, $1");
// Output: "Doe, John"
```

This means:

* `$1` refers to the first captured group (`John`)
* `$2` refers to the second captured group (`Doe`)

Thus, you can rearrange matched content dynamically.

## 2️⃣ Non-Capturing Groups `(?: )`

A **non-capturing group** allows you to group multiple patterns together **without storing** the matched text.
This helps to simplify complex expressions where grouping is required for logic (e.g., alternation), but you do not need to capture the group’s content.

### Syntax:

```regex
(?:pattern)
```

### Example:

```js
/(?:red|blue) car/
```

This pattern matches both `"red car"` and `"blue car"`, but does **not** store `"red"` or `"blue"` as separate captured groups.
Non-capturing groups are used when:

* You want to apply quantifiers to grouped patterns.
* You want to use alternation (`|`) logically without unnecessary capturing.

They make regex cleaner and prevent unwanted group numbering.

## 3️⃣ Look-Aheads — `(?= )` and `(?! )`

**Look-aheads** allow conditional matching based on what follows the current position in the string.
They **peek ahead** without consuming any characters — meaning they check what comes next without including it in the match.
There are two types: **positive** and **negative** look-aheads.

---

### ✅ Positive Look-Ahead `(?= )`

Matches a pattern **only if** it is immediately followed by another specific pattern.

### Syntax:

```regex
A(?=B)
```

This reads as:

> Match “A” only if it is followed by “B”.

### Example:

```js
"apple pie".match(/apple(?= pie)/);
// Matches "apple"
```

* `"apple"` is matched because it is followed by `" pie"`.
* `"apple"` in `"apple juice"` would not be matched.

Positive look-aheads are useful for **conditional validation**, where the presence of a following element is required.

---

### ❌ Negative Look-Ahead `(?! )`

Matches a pattern **only if** it is *not* followed by another specific pattern.

### Syntax:

```regex
A(?!B)
```

This reads as:

> Match “A” only if it is **not** followed by “B”.

### Example:

```js
"cat mouse".match(/cat(?! dog)/);
// Matches "cat"
```

But in `"cat dog"`, there is **no match**, because `"cat"` is followed by `" dog"`.

Negative look-aheads are useful for **filtering** or **excluding** specific conditions while still matching others.

| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Capturing Group     | `( )`   | Captures and stores matched text                | `(John) (Doe)`  | “John Doe” → Groups 1 & 2 |                       |
| Non-Capturing Group | `(?: )` | Groups patterns without capturing               | `(?:red         | blue) car`                | “red car”, “blue car” |
| Positive Look-Ahead | `(?= )` | Matches only if followed by specific text       | `apple(?= pie)` | “apple” in “apple pie”    |                       |
| Negative Look-Ahead | `(?! )` | Matches only if *not* followed by specific text | `cat(?! dog)`   | “cat” in “cat mouse”      |                       |

## 🧰 Real-World Applications

1. **Capturing Groups**

   * Extract names, email addresses, or HTML tags from text.
   * Reorganize text during replacements (e.g., reversing “First Last” to “Last, First”).

2. **Non-Capturing Groups**

   * Simplify alternations and group complex expressions logically.
   * Improve regex readability and avoid unnecessary captures.

3. **Look-Aheads**

   * Validate password formats (e.g., ensure at least one number or uppercase letter).
   * Exclude unwanted matches (e.g., find “cat” not followed by “dog”).

These constructs enhance precision and flexibility in text processing.

3. Non-capturing groups use the syntax ______.
4. The pattern `(?:red|blue) car` matches both “red car” and “blue car”, but doesn’t ______ “red” or “blue”.
5. A positive look-ahead uses the symbol ______ and checks if something is ______.
6. The expression `apple(?= pie)` will match `"apple"` only when it’s followed by `"_____"`.

9. Capturing groups can be reused in replacements using symbols like ______ and ______.
10. Use groups and look-aheads when you need your regex to not just *match*, but also *______, ______,* and *control* what comes next.
