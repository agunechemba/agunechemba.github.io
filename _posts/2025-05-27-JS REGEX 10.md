# JS REGEX 10: Extracting Specific Data with RegExp and `exec()` in JavaScript

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/js-regex-1.jpg" width="100%">

Regular Expressions, or RegExps, are patterns used to match, locate, and extract parts of text. They are essential when working with strings that follow a particular structure — like emails, URLs, or HTML tags.

---

### 1. What is a Regular Expression?

A Regular Expression (RegExp) is a symbolic pattern that defines a set of strings. It helps identify specific sequences within text.
Typical uses include:

* Validating input (e.g., email addresses or phone numbers).
* Extracting structured data from unstructured text.
* Searching and replacing text efficiently.
* Splitting or cleaning large text inputs.

---

### 2. Capturing Groups

Parentheses `( )` in regex not only group expressions but also **capture** portions of the match.
This means the data matched inside `( )` is stored separately, allowing easy extraction.

Example:

```regex
(John) (Doe)
```

Applied to `"John Doe"`, the results are:

* `match[0]`: `"John Doe"` – full match
* `match[1]`: `"John"` – first captured group
* `match[2]`: `"Doe"` – second captured group

Capturing groups make regex useful for data extraction, not just text matching.

---

### 3. The `exec()` Method

In JavaScript, `RegExp.exec(string)` executes a search for a match in a string and returns detailed results as an array.

The returned array includes:

* `match[0]`: the full match.
* `match[1]`, `match[2]`, ...: captured groups.
* Properties like `index` (the position of the match) and `input` (the original string).

If no match is found, `exec()` returns `null`.

### 4. Extracting Data Example

Suppose you want to extract both the URL and text from an HTML anchor tag:

```html
<a href="http://goalkicker.com">goalkicker</a>
```

The JavaScript code:

```js
const html = '<a href="http://goalkicker.com">goalkicker</a>';
const regex = /<a href="(https?:\/\/[^"]+)">([^<]+)<\/a>/;

const result = regex.exec(html);

console.log(result[0]); // <a href="http://goalkicker.com">goalkicker</a>
console.log(result[1]); // http://goalkicker.com
console.log(result[2]); // goalkicker
```

Explanation:

* `(https?:\/\/[^"]+)` captures the URL.
* `([^<]+)` captures the visible link text.
* The parentheses ensure these values are stored separately in the match array.

### 5. Extracting Multiple Matches

Without the global flag `g`, `exec()` only returns the **first** match.
Adding `g` allows multiple matches to be processed sequentially in a loop.

```js
const html = `
  <a href="http://goalkicker.com">goalkicker</a>
  <a href="http://example.com">Example</a>
`;

const regex = /<a href="(https?:\/\/[^"]+)">([^<]+)<\/a>/g;

let match;
while ((match = regex.exec(html)) !== null) {
  console.log("URL:", match[1]);
  console.log("Text:", match[2]);
}
```

Each loop iteration retrieves the next match because `exec()` tracks its progress using the internal property `lastIndex`. When all matches are found, it returns `null`.

### 6. Common Mistakes and Fixes

1. **Missing quotes in patterns:**
   Incorrect: `/href=(https?:\/\/[^"]+)/`
   Correct: `/href="(https?:\/\/[^"]+)"/`

2. **Omitting the `g` flag:**
   Without `g`, only the first match is found.

3. **Using greedy quantifiers:**
   `.+` matches as much as possible, often too much.
   Use the lazy version `.+?` to stop at the nearest match.

---

### 7. When `exec()` Returns `null`

If the target text does not contain any substring that matches the given regex, the return value is `null`.

Example:

```js
/<img src="(.+?)">/.exec("<a href='link'>link</a>")
// Returns null
```

This happens because there is no `<img>` tag in the input string.

---

### 8. Practice Tasks

1. Extract the `href` and link text from

   ```html
   <a href="https://site.com">Site</a>
   ```

   What is stored in `match[1]`?

2. Write a regex to capture the `src` and `alt` values from

   ```html
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
   ```

3. Correct the following regex:

   ```js
   const regex = /<a href=(https?:\/\/[^"]+)>([^<]*)<\/a>/;
   ```

4. Use `exec()` in a loop to extract all email addresses from:

   ```
   "Contact us at info@company.com or support@help.org"
   ```

5. Explain why `exec()` sometimes returns `null`.
