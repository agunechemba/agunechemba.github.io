### 👨‍🏫 Meet William Kahan – The Man Who Tamed the Unknown

Back in the 1980s, William Kahan was on a secret mission. His goal? Fix how computers handle impossible or unknown calculations.

Inspired by stories from his mathematician father, he recalled one tale in particular: a genius mathematician whose lifelong equation was destroyed by a mysterious value. They called it **"the devil’s number."**

### 🧠 The Problem: Weird Math That Breaks Code

Some operations confuse computers. Here are a few:

* `0 / 0` → Division by zero
* `Math.sqrt(-1)` → Square root of a negative
* `Math.log(-1)` → Log of a negative
* `Math.acos(2)` → Arccos of value > 1
* `Math.atan("hello")` → Arctangent of a string
* `5 * "hello"` or `5 + "hello"` → Mixing numbers and strings

All of these return something… but not what you'd expect.

### 💡 The Solution: *NaN* — Not-a-Number

Kahan’s breakthrough? A special value to represent **“I don’t know what this is.”**

He called it **NaN** — short for *Not-a-Number*.

This wasn't just a label. It became the foundation of how computers handle impossible results.

### 🌍 The Impact: IEEE 754 Standard

NaN became a key part of the **IEEE 754** standard — the global rulebook for how computers do math.

Thanks to Kahan, your code won’t crash when it hits strange math. It simply returns `NaN`, so your program can handle it smartly.

### 🧪 JavaScript in Action

Here’s how JavaScript handles some devilish math:

```js
console.log(0 / 0);           // NaN
console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));   // NaN
console.log(5 * "hello");     // NaN
console.log(5 + "hello");     // "5hello" (string)
```

No explosions. Just `NaN`. That’s Kahan’s legacy in action.

### 🎉 Happy Birthday, William Kahan!

To the man who helped computers make sense of the senseless — thank you!
Your work changed how we program, calculate, and code.

Here’s to you, the man who conquered the devil’s number.
