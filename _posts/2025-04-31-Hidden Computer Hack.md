## 🦠 1. Run Your Computer’s Native Antivirus

Many people don’t know that Windows comes with a built-in antivirus tool called the **Malicious Software Removal Tool (MRT)**. Here’s how to use it:

### ✅ Steps:

1. Press **Windows + R** on your keyboard.
   This opens the **Run** dialog box.
2. Type `MRT` and hit **Enter** or click **OK**.
3. A new window will open. Click **Next**.
4. Choose **Quick Scan** and let it do its job.

🎯 **What it does**: This tool checks your PC for well-known threats and removes them. It’s super light and runs in the background. Most IT guys won’t tell you this because it’s already on your system!

## 🗑️ 2. Delete Junk Files to Free Up Space

Every time you install apps, browse the internet, or update software, your computer stores temporary files that *pile up* and slow things down.

### ✅ Clean it up:

1. Press **Windows + R** again.
2. Type `%temp%` and hit **Enter**.
3. A folder full of weird-named files will pop up.
4. Press **CTRL + A** to select all.
5. Press **Delete** on your keyboard.

💡 **Note**: These are just *temporary files*. Your PC doesn’t need them. Deleting them is 100% safe and can free up gigabytes of space!

## 🚫 3. Disable Startup Apps

Ever noticed your computer taking forever to boot up? That’s probably because too many apps are starting automatically in the background.

### ✅ Take control:

1. Press **CTRL + SHIFT + ESC** to open **Task Manager**.
2. Click on the **Startup** tab.
3. You’ll see a list of apps that launch when your computer starts.
4. Right-click on any app you don’t need immediately and click **Disable**.

📌 **Pro Tip**: Be careful not to disable essential apps like antivirus software.
