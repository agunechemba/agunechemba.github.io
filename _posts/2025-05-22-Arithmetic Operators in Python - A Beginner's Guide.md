Once upon a code-time, in the kingdom of Pythonland, there lived a brilliant superhero called **Captain Calculator**. His job? To help young coders like YOU learn how to do math in Python using powerful magic symbols called **operators**. 🧙‍♂️🔣

Let’s hop on his math-mobile and go on an adventure through the **seven lands of Arithmetic Operators**. Each land has a different power. Are you ready? Let’s ride! 🚀

---

## 🏰 Land of Addition (`+`): "The Friendly Joiner"

Captain Calculator says, *"This symbol helps you join numbers together."*

```python
print(1 + 1)  # Output: 2
```

Two little ducks joined flippers. And poof! They became two.

---

## 🏜️ Land of Subtraction (`-`): "The Number Picker"

Sometimes, you need to take something away — maybe a cookie 🍪 from your snack pack.

```python
print(5 - 2)  # Output: 3
```

Captain Calculator smiled. “Took 2 cookies from 5 — now you have 3 left!”

---

## 🏗️ Land of Multiplication (`*`): "The Fast Doubler"

*“When you need more in a flash,”* says the Captain.

```python
print(3 * 4)  # Output: 12
```

Three boxes with 4 apples each — boom! You’ve got 12 apples! 🍎🍎🍎

---

## 🌊 Land of Division (`/`): "The Equal Sharer"

In this land, everyone gets a fair share.

```python
print(8 / 2)  # Output: 4.0
```

Eight candies, two kids. *Each gets four candies.* Easy math!

---

## 🌀 Land of Modulus (`%`): "The Remainder Revealer"

Captain Calculator whispered, *"This is my sneaky trick. I’ll tell you what’s left after sharing!"*

```python
print(10 % 3)  # Output: 1
```

Shared 10 balloons among 3 kids. One balloon is left behind. 🎈

---

## 🌟 Land of Exponentiation (`**`): "The Power Booster"

When you want to make a number super strong 💪.

```python
print(2 ** 4)  # Output: 16
```

2 to the power of 4 is like saying: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. Ka-BOOM! 16! 💥

---

## 🧱 Land of Floor Division (`//`): "The Ground Cutter"

This operator chops off the decimal and gives you just the full parts.

```python
print(7 // 2)  # Output: 3
```

“Only full pizzas, please!” 🍕

## 🧪 Captain’s Potion Pack: Compound Assignment Operators

When Captain Calculator is in a hurry, he uses **shortcuts** like these:

Let’s say we start with:

```python
age = 8
```

### ➕ Add and Assign (`+=`)

```python
age += 2  # Same as age = age + 2
```

Now `age` becomes 10. Birthday party time! 🎂

### ➖ Subtract and Assign (`-=`)

```python
age -= 3
```

Back in time? Age becomes 7.

### ✖️ Multiply and Assign (`*=`)

```python
age *= 2
```

Now you’ve doubled! Age is 14.

### ➗ Divide and Assign (`/=`)

```python
age /= 2
```

Split your age in half? Now it’s 7.0 (a float).

### 💥 Others: `%=` for modulus, `**=` for powers, and `//=` for floor division — all work the same!

## 📊 Captain’s Treasure Map: Summary Table

| Operator | What It Does       | Example   | Result |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Add                | `2 + 3`   | `5`    |
| `-`      | Subtract           | `7 - 2`   | `5`    |
| `*`      | Multiply           | `3 * 3`   | `9`    |
| `/`      | Divide (float)     | `8 / 2`   | `4.0`  |
| `%`      | Remainder          | `9 % 4`   | `1`    |
| `**`     | Raise to Power     | `2 ** 3`  | `8`    |
| `//`     | Divide, Round Down | `10 // 3` | `3`    |

Captain Calculator raised his wand and shouted:

> “Now you, my young apprentice, can use Python to do math like a wizard! Go forth and code!”

## 🧠 Review and Practice Time

1. **What will be printed when you run this code?**

   ```python
   result = 10 % 4
   print(result)
   ```

2. **Which operator would you use to calculate “3 to the power of 4”?**

3. **Fill in the blank to increase `count` by 5:**

   ```python
   count = 10  
   count ___ 5
   ```

4. **Guess what this code will output:**

   ```python
   number = 20  
   number //= 3  
   print(number)
   ```

5. **Your turn! Write a Python program that:**

   * Starts with `score = 5`
   * Adds 2
   * Multiplies by 3
   * Prints the final score
