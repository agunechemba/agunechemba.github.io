When you're working with numbers in Python, you'll often need to perform basic arithmetic operations. Python makes this super easy with built-in operators.

### üß± Basic Arithmetic Operators

Here are the main ones you need to know:

#### ‚ûï Addition (`+`)

```
print(1 + 1)  # Output: 2
```

**Explanation:** Adds two numbers together.

#### ‚ûñ Subtraction (`-`)

```
print(2 - 1)  # Output: 1
```

**Explanation:** Subtracts the second number from the first.

#### ‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication (`*`)

```
print(2 * 2)  # Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** Multiplies the numbers.

#### ‚ûó Division (`/`)

```
print(4 / 2)  # Output: 2.0
```

**Explanation:** Divides the first number by the second and returns a float.

#### üßπ Modulus (`%`)

```
print(4 % 3)  # Output: 1
```

**Explanation:** Returns the remainder when dividing. `4 % 3 = 1`.

#### üîº Exponentiation (`**`)

```
print(4 ** 2)  # Output: 16
```

**Explanation:** Raises the first number to the power of the second. `4^2 = 16`

#### üîª Floor Division (`//`)

```
print(4 // 2)  # Output: 2
```

**Explanation:** Divides and rounds down (removes decimals).

### üß™ Compound Assignment Operators

These are shortcuts for updating the value of a variable:

Let's say:

```
age = 8
```

#### `+=`

```
age += 1  # Same as age = age + 1
print(age)  # Output: 9
```

#### `-=`

```
age -= 2
print(age)  # Output: 7
```

#### `*=`

```
age *= 2
print(age)  # Output: 14
```

#### `/=`

```
age /= 2
print(age)  # Output: 7.0
```

#### `%=`

```
age %= 5
print(age)  # Output: 2
```

You can also use `**=` and `//=` in the same way.

### üìì Summary Table

| Operator | Meaning        | Example  | Result |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition       | `2 + 3`  | `5`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `5 - 2`  | `3`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `3 * 3`  | `9`    |
| `/`      | Division       | `10 / 2` | `5.0`  |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `10 % 3` | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3` | `8`    |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `9 // 2` | `4`    |

Now you're ready to do some math with Python like a pro!

## Review Questions

Here are 5 beginner-friendly practice questions to add at the end of your guide:

### üß† Practice Questions

1. **What will be the output?**

   ```
   result = 10 % 4
   print(result)
   ```

2. **Which operator would you use to calculate 3 raised to the power of 4?**

3. **Fill in the blank to increase the value of `count` by 5:**

   ```
   count = 10  
   count ___ 5
   ```

4. **What will this code print?**

   ```
   number = 20  
   number //= 3  
   print(number)
   ```

5. **Write a small code snippet that:**

   * Starts with `score = 5`
   * Adds 2 to it
   * Multiplies the result by 3
   * Prints the final score
