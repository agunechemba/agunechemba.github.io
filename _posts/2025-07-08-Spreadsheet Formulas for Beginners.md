## 📘 A Day in the Digital Classroom

In a bright and cheerful computer lab filled with the sound of clacking keyboards and curious minds, young learners gathered around their screens. It was the kind of morning where discovery was in the air — and today’s adventure would take them deep into the heart of spreadsheets.

"Did you know," someone whispered, "that you can *type math* into a box and the computer will solve it for you?"

And just like that, the doors opened to a magical world where spreadsheets didn’t just store numbers — they *worked with them*.

## 🧮 The Magic Begins: What Are Spreadsheet Formulas?

Imagine having a calculator that lives inside each tiny square of a spreadsheet — a calculator that doesn’t need buttons, just a typed command.

All it takes to wake it up is an **equal sign (`=`)**. The moment a formula begins with that little symbol, the spreadsheet understands: *"Oh! Time to do some math!"*

For example:

```excel
=2+2
```

Type that into a cell and press Enter, and the box will instantly show `4`. Like magic.

## ✨ Spells Every Spreadsheet Wizard Should Know

Once the basic magic was understood, the young learners were ready to explore the most useful formulas — the ones that make spreadsheets come alive.

### 🔢 Adding with `=SUM(...)`

Want to quickly add numbers from cell A1 to A4?

```excel
=SUM(A1:A4)
```

This powerful command scoops up all the numbers in that range and adds them in a blink.

---

### 📏 Finding the Mean with `=AVERAGE(...)`

Suppose you have scores from three tests. To find out the average score:

```excel
=AVERAGE(B1:B4)
```

This formula adds the scores and divides them evenly, just like a fair teacher grading tests.

---

### 🎯 Making Decisions with `=IF(...)`

Spreadsheets can also *think*. Imagine checking if a score is high enough to pass:

```excel
=IF(C2>=50, "Passed", "Try Again")
```

If the value in C2 is 50 or more, the result is “Passed.” If not, it gently says “Try Again.”

---

### 🏅 Who’s Highest or Lowest? Use `=MAX(...)` and `=MIN(...)`

To find the top score in a class:

```excel
=MAX(A2:A10)
```

And to discover the lowest score:

```excel
=MIN(A2:A10)
```

These two are like spotlight beams — shining on the highest performer or the one who might need more help.

---

### 📆 Today’s Date with `=TODAY()`

No need to check the calendar. Just type:

```excel
=TODAY()
```

The cell will magically fill with today’s date and update itself every time the sheet is opened.

---

### 🔍 Searching Smartly with `=VLOOKUP(...)`

What if you have a list of students and their scores, and you want to find one student’s result? This powerful spell lets you search:

```excel
=VLOOKUP("Ada", A2:E10, 5, FALSE)
```

It finds “Ada” in the first column and returns the value from the 5th column in her row — maybe her total score or final grade.

## 💻 Spreadsheet Practice Time

Now, it’s your turn to type along and try out the formulas yourself!

---

### 📊 **Activity 1: Total and Average Scores**

Start by building this table beginning in cell **A1**:

| Name  | Score 1 | Score 2 | Score 3 |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Ada   | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Bola  | 18      | 22      | 30      |
| Chika | 17      | 19      | 21      |

In column **E**, type:

```excel
=SUM(B2:D2)
```

Drag it down for all rows — this gives the **total score** per student.

Now, in column **F**, try:

```excel
=AVERAGE(B2:D2)
```

Again, drag it down — you'll get the **average score** for each student.

---

### 🧠 **Activity 2: Pass or Try Again?**

In column **G**, create a formula to judge the averages:

```excel
=IF(F2>=20, "Passed", "Try Again")
```

Use the fill handle to copy this for all students.

---

### 🏆 **Activity 3: Highest and Lowest Total Scores**

Scroll to **E6** and **E7**, and type:

```excel
=MAX(E2:E4)  → in E6
=MIN(E2:E4)  → in E7
```

You now know who scored highest and lowest!

---

### 📅 **Activity 4: Display Today’s Date**

Click on **H1** and type:

```excel
=TODAY()
```

Watch today’s date appear as if by magic!

---

### 🔍 **Activity 5: Find Chika’s Total**

In **J2**, type:

```excel
=VLOOKUP("Chika", A2:F4, 5, FALSE)
```

The spreadsheet searches for “Chika” and brings back her **total score** from column E.

---

### 🌟 Bonus Task:

Create your own table of **5 students and 4 scores**. Then:

* Calculate total and average
* Use `IF()` to mark who passed
* Try a `VLOOKUP()` to search for a name like "Emeka" or "Zara"

## ✅ Quick Review Time

Before wrapping up your spreadsheet journey, here are five quick review questions to test your magical knowledge:

1. What symbol do all spreadsheet formulas begin with?
2. How do you add all the values from cell A1 to A5?
3. Write an `IF` formula that says “Excellent” if a number is 75 or more.
4. What’s the difference between `=COUNT(A1:A5)` and `=COUNTA(A1:A5)`?
5. What does `=VLOOKUP("Maya", A2:F6, 5, FALSE)` do?
