### 🔍 What is `substring()`?

The `substring()` method extracts characters from a string, between two specified indices.

```
string.substring(start, end)
```

* **`start`**: The index where extraction begins.
* **`end`** *(optional)*: The index before which to stop. If omitted, extraction goes to the end of the string.

### ✂️ Practical Examples

```
let str = "Hello, world!";

// Extract "world"
let substring1 = str.substring(7, 12); // "world"

// Extract from the beginning to "o"
let substring2 = str.substring(0, 4); // "Hell"

// Extract from "o" to the end
let substring3 = str.substring(4); // "o, world!"
```

### 💡 Key Points to Remember

* `substring()` **does not modify** the original string—it returns a **new one**.
* Indices are **zero-based** (first character is index 0).
* If `end` is **omitted**, it extracts till the end of the string.
* If `start` is **greater than** `end`, JavaScript automatically **swaps** them.
