# üßæ  Google Apps Script: Displaying ‚ÄúHELLO WORLD!‚Äù As A Toast Message

Instead of popping up a dialog box that interrupts your work, your script quietly slides a neat little notification into the corner of your Google Sheet ‚Äî friendly, elegant, and non-intrusive.

That, my dear coder, is called a **Toast Message**.
And in today‚Äôs lesson, we‚Äôll explore how to create one using Google Apps Script.

Let‚Äôs begin our warm, buttery toast of code:

---

## üçû The Code

```javascript
function greeting() {
  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()
    .toast("Hello World!", "Greeting");
}
```

Short, smooth, and deliciously efficient.
At first glance, it looks similar to our earlier `Browser.msgBox()` example, but the experience it creates inside Google Sheets is quite different.

So, what‚Äôs really going on behind those two lines? Let‚Äôs peel the layers.

---

## üß© Step 1: The Function Declaration

```javascript
function greeting() {
```

This line declares a function named `greeting`.

* The keyword `function` is the command to define a reusable block of code.
* The name `greeting` is how we‚Äôll refer to this function whenever we want to call it.

No parameters are passed ‚Äî meaning this function doesn‚Äôt need any input to run.

When you call `greeting()`, everything inside the curly braces `{ ... }` runs.

---

## üß© Step 2: Accessing the Spreadsheet

```javascript
SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()
```

This is the line that **connects your script to the actual Google Sheet** that‚Äôs open right now.

Let‚Äôs break that chain down:

### üîπ `SpreadsheetApp`

This is the Google Apps Script **service** that gives your code the ability to talk to and manipulate Google Sheets.

It can do all sorts of things ‚Äî create new sheets, read or write data, change formatting, and much more.

### üîπ `getActiveSpreadsheet()`

This method tells the script:

> ‚ÄúGive me the spreadsheet that‚Äôs currently open and active.‚Äù

So, at this point, your function is literally ‚Äúgrabbing‚Äù the current Google Sheet so it can do something inside it.

---

## üß© Step 3: The `.toast()` Method

Now here‚Äôs the hero of the story:

```javascript
.toast("Hello World!", "Greeting");
```

This is a **method** ‚Äî a built-in function attached to the spreadsheet object you just accessed.

In plain English, it means:

> ‚ÄúShow a short notification on this spreadsheet.‚Äù

### üßà Toast messages in Google Sheets

A **toast** is a small pop-up notification that appears in the bottom-right corner of your Google Sheet ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt block your work or require any button click.

You might‚Äôve seen similar ones like:

> ‚ÄúFile saved.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúCopy completed.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúForm submitted successfully.‚Äù

They‚Äôre perfect for quick, friendly feedback without disturbing the user.

---

## üß© Step 4: The Toast Arguments

The `toast()` method takes **two main arguments** (though it can take more):

```javascript
.toast(message, title)
```

So in our example:

```javascript
.toast("Hello World!", "Greeting");
```

### ü•á `"Hello World!"` ‚Äì The Message

This is what the toast actually says ‚Äî the main content of the little notification box.
You can change it to anything like:

> `"Data Updated Successfully!"` or `"Welcome to Pepe Programming Hub!"`

### ü•à `"Greeting"` ‚Äì The Title

This is the **heading** displayed above the message. It appears in bold text and helps categorize the notification.

So your toast might look like this in the corner of your Google Sheet:

```
Greeting
Hello World!
```

Short, friendly, and non-disruptive.

---

## üß© Step 5: What Happens When It Runs

When you click **Run** in your Google Apps Script editor (while connected to a Google Sheet), this function:

1. Connects to your currently open spreadsheet.
2. Displays a short toast message in the lower-right corner of the screen.
3. Shows:

   * Title: **Greeting**
   * Message: **Hello World!**

And then‚Ä¶ it quietly disappears after a few seconds ‚Äî no clicks needed!

It‚Äôs one of those tiny touches that make your spreadsheet feel smart and responsive.

## üß© Step 6: Why Use `.toast()` Instead of `Browser.msgBox()`?

Both show messages ‚Äî but they serve different purposes.

| Feature                 | `Browser.msgBox()`          | `SpreadsheetApp.toast()`   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type                    | Popup dialog box            | Non-intrusive notification |
| User must click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù?   | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No                       |
| Appears where?          | Center of screen            | Bottom-right of Sheet      |
| Stops script execution? | ‚úÖ Yes (until user responds) | ‚ùå No (runs in background)  |
| Best used for           | Confirmations or decisions  | Quick feedback or info     |

So, when you want a **gentle notification** ‚Äî use `.toast()`.
When you want **interaction or confirmation** ‚Äî use `.msgBox()`.

## üß© Step 7: Practical Uses

Here are a few cool ways you might use toast messages:

‚úÖ Show a completion message:

```javascript
toast("Data saved successfully!", "Done");
```

‚úÖ Display progress during long tasks:

```javascript
toast("Sorting data...", "Please wait");
```

‚úÖ Greet the user when the sheet opens:

```javascript
toast("Welcome to Pepe Hub Sheet!", "Hello");
```

‚úÖ Notify about errors (in a friendly way):

```javascript
toast("Oops! Something went wrong.", "Error");
```

## üß† Summary

Let‚Äôs summarize today‚Äôs little Google Sheet snack:

| Code Component           | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SpreadsheetApp`         | Gives access to Google Sheets services                                 |
| `getActiveSpreadsheet()` | Refers to the open spreadsheet                                         |
| `.toast()`               | Displays a short notification message                                  |
| `"Hello World!"`         | The message text                                                       |
| `"Greeting"`             | The title of the toast                                                 |
| **Result:**              | A ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù toast appears in the bottom-right corner of the Sheet |
