# 💡JavaScript Functions Made Easy: From Code to Quiz in Minutes

If you’re just getting started with JavaScript, understanding functions is one of the best moves you can make. In this short, practical lesson, we’ll look at how functions work using numbers—no strings attached. Ready? Let’s go!

### 🚀 What’s a Function in JavaScript?

A **function** is a block of code that does something when you call it. Think of it like a mini-machine: you give it input, it gives you output.

Here’s a simple example:

```
// Define a function
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}

// Call the function
let result = square(5);

console.log(result); // Output: 25
```

This function takes one number, squares it, and prints the result. Easy!

### ✌️ Using Two Numbers? No Problem

Let’s try a function that works with two numbers instead of one:

```
// Define a function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Call the function
let result = add(7, 3);

console.log(result); // Output: 10
```

**Breakdown:**

* `function add(a, b)` creates a function with two inputs.
* `return a + b` adds them.
* `add(7, 3)` returns `10`.
* `console.log(result)` prints `10`.

Simple, clear, and super useful.
