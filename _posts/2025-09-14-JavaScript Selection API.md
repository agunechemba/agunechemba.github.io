Imagine you‚Äôre in school, reading your textbook. You pull out a **yellow highlighter** to mark important words.
Now imagine that your highlighter is **magical**:

* It not only highlights words, but also lets your computer **know exactly what you selected**.
* The computer can then **copy it, save it, or even replace it** with something new.

That‚Äôs what the **Selection API** does in JavaScript‚Äîit‚Äôs like a magic highlighter for web pages.

### **What is the Selection API?**

The Selection API allows you to:

* **Find out what text the user has selected** (like highlighting text with a mouse).
* **Modify or replace** that selection.
* **Copy or save** the highlighted content.

### **Example**

Let‚Äôs say you highlight text on a web page. JavaScript can check what you selected:

```
let selection = window.getSelection();
console.log(selection.toString());
```

If you highlighted the words ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, it will log:

```
Hello World
```
