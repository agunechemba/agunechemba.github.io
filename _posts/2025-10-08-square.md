### Line-by-line explanation (a friendly walkthrough)

Nice small program — it’s a complete little recipe that tells the browser to draw a red 100×100 square on a 400×400 canvas. I’ll walk through each line as if we were standing next to the code and pointing to what it does.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This line tells the browser “this is an HTML5 document.” It forces standards mode so the page renders consistently across browsers.

```html
<html>
```

Opens the root `<html>` element. Everything on the page lives inside this.

```html
<head>
```

Starts the document head — the place for metadata (title, links to stylesheets, meta tags). Content in `<head>` is not shown on the page itself.

```html
  <title>Square Drawing</title>
```

Sets the text you see in the browser tab (or the window title). Here the tab will read “Square Drawing”.

```html
</head>
<body>
```

Closes the head and opens the visible part of the page — everything inside `<body>` is rendered on-screen.

```html
  <canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400" style="border:1px solid black;"></canvas>
```

This is the drawing surface.

* `<canvas>` is an HTML element that provides a pixel grid you can draw into using JavaScript.
* `id="canvas"` gives it a name so JavaScript can find it with `getElementById`.
* `width="400" height="400"` set the canvas’s internal coordinate system to 400×400 pixels (important — these are the drawing resolution).
* `style="border:1px solid black;"` is inline CSS that draws a 1-pixel black border around the canvas so you can see its edges on the page.
* Note: the canvas’s origin `(0,0)` is at its **top-left** corner; x increases to the right, y increases downward.

```html
  <script>
```

Starts the JavaScript block. The browser will execute the script as it parses this tag. Because the script is placed after the `<canvas>` element, the canvas is already in the DOM and available to the script.

```js
    const ctx = document.getElementById("canvas").getContext("2d");
```

This is a key line.

* `document.getElementById("canvas")` finds the `<canvas>` element by its `id`.
* `.getContext("2d")` asks the canvas for a 2D drawing context — an object (`ctx`) with methods and properties for drawing lines, shapes, text, images, etc.
* `const ctx =` stores that context in the constant variable `ctx`. From now on `ctx` is our “pen.”

```js
    ctx.beginPath();       // Start drawing
```

`beginPath()` starts a new path. Think of it as lifting a fresh sheet of paper for a new shape — it resets the current subpath so the lines you add next form a single logical shape rather than being joined to previous stuff.

```js
    ctx.moveTo(50, 50);    // Start point
```

`moveTo(x, y)` moves the virtual pen to the coordinates (50, 50) **without** drawing. This sets the starting point for the next drawing commands. In our canvas coordinate system that point is 50 pixels right and 50 pixels down from the top-left.

```js
    ctx.lineTo(150, 50);   // Top edge
```

`lineTo(x, y)` adds a straight line segment from the current point (50,50) to (150,50) to the current path. It does not render anything on screen yet; it just records the geometry.

```js
    ctx.lineTo(150, 150);  // Right edge
```

Adds another line from (150,50) down to (150,150). The path now contains two connected segments.

```js
    ctx.lineTo(50, 150);   // Bottom edge
```

Adds the bottom edge from (150,150) left to (50,150).

```js
    ctx.lineTo(50, 50);    // Left edge (back to start)
```

Adds the left edge back up to the starting point (50,50). This completes the rectangle/square outline. (An alternative would be `ctx.closePath()` which also closes the path by connecting the current point to the starting point.)

```js
    ctx.strokeStyle = "red";
```

Sets the stroke (outline) color for the path. This accepts any valid CSS color string (e.g., `"red"`, `"#ff0000"`, `"rgb(255,0,0)"`).

```js
    ctx.lineWidth = 4;
```

Sets the thickness of lines in pixels. Here each side will be drawn 4 pixels wide.

```js
    ctx.stroke();          // Draw the square
```

`stroke()` actually paints the outline of the current path onto the canvas using the current `strokeStyle`, `lineWidth`, and related settings. Until this call, the lines were only in memory; `stroke()` makes them visible.

```html
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Closes the script tag, body and html — end of the document.
