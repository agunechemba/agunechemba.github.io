Lately, I’ve been seeing the same question pop up everywhere: *“Is it even worth learning to code now that AI can do so much?”* Honestly, I get where that fear comes from. Headlines keep telling us AI is taking jobs, and it’s easy to feel discouraged. But after digging into a Reddit discussion titled *“<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mtcgcf/stop_being_scared_of_ai_and_just_learn_to_program/?%24deep_link=true&correlation_id=6c77bf62-647d-4004-8050-bfc8d293843f&post_fullname=t3_1mtcgcf&post_index=0&ref=email_digest&ref_campaign=email_digest&ref_source=email&utm_content=post_body&%243p=e_as&_branch_match_id=1486639510954775375&utm_medium=Email+Amazon+SES&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA21Q0U7DMAz8mu6tW2m6biBNCIH4DStN3C4jiSMnVeGFb8fdBk9IiXS6s%2B9OPpeS8tNux2itK1ud0ta7%2BLFT6blqO5VOCDpvBBK7yUXtYWZ%2FOq9blXqp2nd5y7Js7%2FuGghAs36PmmJgm1iG4OAklYsBYssCHUMxkRkG5UIIBZQKy0WIDNIJ2oKOFy5wLXI2gENzN1kwlsfu2s4gJ1rqVeis8Y9X2hpjR6%2BIogrPC9%2BZwGMa%2BrfvuYOuuabr62OybehjN0baP6tgpqdEnkqhx9j7qgKudgr%2BON9FFi5%2BiNEIwjoIwaOfBuglzuZFgdEjaTfF%2FNdPMBn81IecSwFAschVhrzED2a%2FNt0wj83qUgWnJyKfXM1PAH8W8Ti2vAQAA" target="_blank">“Stop being scared of AI and just learn to program,”</a>
,”* and reflecting on my own journey, I think the truth is much more encouraging. Let me walk you through what I learned and how I personally see it.

## Is It Still Worth Learning to Code?

For me, the answer is a clear **yes**. And I loved how one commenter captured it: *“AI is just the next awesome vim plugin—it helps you crank out code faster sometimes.”* Another chimed in: *“It’s like a cordless drill. It won’t magically make you a carpenter.”* That hit home for me, because when I started coding, I had to realize that tools don’t replace skill—they just make skill more effective.

So even with AI, learning to code is still valuable. What’s changing is how we work, not whether the work matters.

## Coding vs. Programming: What’s the Difference?

The original poster made a point that resonated with me: *“Programming is not coding and it has never been the same. Coding is just the tippity top of the iceberg.”* I’ve felt this in my own practice—syntax is one thing, but programming goes deeper: problem-solving, system design, and collaborating with others.

Of course, not everyone agreed. One commenter bluntly called this *“pointless ‘distinction without difference’ bullshit.”* I get that too. Job titles and expectations vary so widely that sometimes drawing lines doesn’t help. But I still think there’s value in remembering that *just typing code* is not the same as truly solving problems.

## AI’s Capabilities—and Its Shortcomings

In my experience, AI really is like a **“power tool.”** As one commenter put it: *“If you know how to build, it makes you faster. If not, it won’t magically turn you into an engineer.”* I’ve definitely seen this. When I lean on AI to draft a function, I still need to know enough to debug, refactor, and decide if it’s even correct.

I’ve also tested AI with small apps, and sometimes the results are a mess. One user described it perfectly: *“The code was garbage—random, unworkable, and impossible to modify without introducing bugs.”* That has been my experience too when I handed over too much control. But at the same time, I’ve seen stories of senior developers using AI tools to incredible effect. One said they wrote *“300k lines of code in July. This isn’t a little bit faster—it’s a revolution.”*

So for me, the conclusion is this: AI is amazing, but only if you bring the skill and judgment to steer it.

## Skills That Still Matter

Here’s what I remind myself whenever I get nervous about AI:

* **Problem-solving and communication** will always be human strengths. AI can’t sit in a product meeting and weigh trade-offs.
* **Judgment** matters. I’ve seen AI confidently spit out wrong answers—it doesn’t weigh risks the way people do.
* **Context is everything.** You have to understand the business problem and the codebase; AI doesn’t.
* **Debugging** is unavoidable. More than once, I’ve thought, “By the time I fix this AI-generated code, I could’ve just written it myself.”
* **Non-coding activities** like reviewing code or brainstorming designs are still human-centric.

These are the skills I focus on growing, because they keep me valuable no matter how good AI gets.

## The Junior Developer Dilemma

I really feel for people just starting out, because one of the biggest fears is whether junior roles are disappearing. Some commenters were blunt: *“Coders can absolutely be replaced. Entry, junior, and mid-tier roles may be phased out.”* That’s scary. And I won’t lie—breaking into tech has always been tough.

But others pointed out that the job crunch is partly due to oversaturation and post-COVID overhiring, not just AI. One said: *“AI is maybe 20% of the problem. The rest is the CS job market itself.”* Personally, I believe juniors will still find a way in, but the path might look different—maybe more project-based, maybe more about proving skills than landing a traditional “junior” role.

## Fear, Motivation, and the Joy of Coding

Here’s something I’ve had to remind myself: if the only reason I’m coding is for quick money, I’ll burn out. One commenter echoed this: *“If you’re only here thinking \$, you’re going to burn out fast.”* For me, the joy is in the creativity and problem-solving—and AI doesn’t take that away.

That said, I don’t dismiss the fear either. Another commenter wrote: *“Fear of uncertainty is appropriate. We don’t know AI’s limits—it could be a tool, or it could be something bigger.”* I feel that too. But fear alone can’t be the driver. What keeps me going is curiosity and the thrill of building.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re wondering whether to learn programming in the age of AI, here’s my honest take: absolutely yes. The field is changing, but that’s nothing new—technology has *always* evolved. AI doesn’t erase the need for human programmers; it shifts what we focus on.

For me, the goal now is to lean into it. I’m learning to code, learning to program, and learning to collaborate with AI instead of resisting it. Because at the end of the day, as one commenter wisely said: *“AI won’t replace programmers. But programmers who use AI will replace programmers who don’t.”*

And I’d add my own twist: coding is still one of the most exciting ways to create, to problem-solve, and to build things that matter. That joy is something no AI can take away.
