Imagine you’re a game designer. You made a game that works perfectly on your PlayStation, but when you try it on Xbox, some buttons act differently. Wouldn’t it be useful if the game could first **check what console** you’re using, then adjust itself?

That’s exactly what **browser detection** in JavaScript does. Websites may need to know what browser a visitor is using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) so they can work smoothly for everyone.

## 🕵️ How Do We Detect the Browser?

The main tool is something called **`navigator.userAgent`**.

* `navigator` is an object in JavaScript that holds information about the web browser.
* `userAgent` is a string (a long sentence) that tells us details about the browser and device.

Example:

```
console.log(navigator.userAgent);
```

If you’re on Chrome, you might see something like:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 ...
Chrome/92.0.4515.159 Safari/537.36
```

If you’re on Firefox, you’d see a different string.

## 🛠️ A Simple Example

```
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Chrome") !== -1) {
  console.log("You are using Chrome!");
} else if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") !== -1) {
  console.log("You are using Firefox!");
} else {
  console.log("Unknown browser.");
}
```

This code **searches the userAgent string** for certain words like “Chrome” or “Firefox.”

## ⚠️ Why Be Careful?

Browser detection is not always reliable because:

1. The `userAgent` string can be **changed or faked**.
2. Browsers update their strings often.
3. It’s better to detect **features** (like “Does this browser support video?”) rather than the browser name.

This is why developers often use **feature detection** instead of plain browser detection.

---

## ✅ Recap

* `navigator.userAgent` tells us about the browser.
* We can search inside it to check if the browser is Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
* But it’s not always reliable—**feature detection** is safer.

## ✏️ Fill-in-the-Gap Questions

1. The `navigator` object in JavaScript holds information about the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. The property `navigator.__________` gives us details about the browser type and version.
3. A common way to detect if the user is on Chrome is to check if the userAgent contains the word \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. Instead of browser detection, developers often prefer \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ detection.
5. Browser detection can be unreliable because the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ string can be changed or faked.
