Yo, welcome to another coding campfire tale! ðŸ”¥
Today, weâ€™re diving into how to convert a *denary number* (thatâ€™s a fancy word for normal numbers like 107) into the secret language of computers â€” **binary** (only 1s and 0s, baby ðŸ˜Ž).

And guess what? There are **two chill ways** to get it done:

* The **"Trial and Error"** way â€” like playing a matching game.
* The **"Successive Division"** way â€” like flipping a bunch of coins.

So grab your hoodie, crack your knuckles, and letâ€™s turn **107** into binary like a total boss.

## ðŸš€ Method 1: Trial and Error (The Coin Collector Game ðŸŽ®)

Imagine youâ€™re at a secret gamer shop that only sells coins in powers of 2:

* 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...

You need to **buy exactly 107** coins using the biggest possible values without going over. Letâ€™s goooo:

* **64** fits into 107 â†’ Remaining = 43 â†’ Put a `1` under 64
* **32** fits into 43 â†’ Remaining = 11 â†’ Put a `1` under 32
* **16** is too big for 11 â†’ Put a `0`
* **8** fits â†’ Remaining = 3 â†’ Put a `1`
* **4** is too big â†’ Put a `0`
* **2** fits â†’ Remaining = 1 â†’ Put a `1`
* **1** fits â†’ Remaining = 0 â†’ Put a `1`

Hereâ€™s your binary lineup:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| 0   | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

So, **107** in binary = **1101011**
âœ¨ Boom, you just built 107 using binary blocks!

## ðŸ§® Method 2: Successive Division by 2 (The Stack & Flip Trick ðŸ”„)

This oneâ€™s all about **dividing by 2** and catching the remainders like PokÃ©mon.

Letâ€™s divide 107 down till we hit zero:

1. 107 Ã· 2 = 53 â€” remainder **1**
2. 53 Ã· 2 = 26 â€” remainder **1**
3. 26 Ã· 2 = 13 â€” remainder **0**
4. 13 Ã· 2 = 6 â€” remainder **1**
5. 6 Ã· 2 = 3 â€” remainder **0**
6. 3 Ã· 2 = 1 â€” remainder **1**
7. 1 Ã· 2 = 0 â€” remainder **1**

Now reverse the remainders (from bottom to top):
**1 1 0 1 0 1 1**

So, 107 in binary = **1101011** again.
ðŸ”¥ Weâ€™re on fire, and we didnâ€™t even need Wi-Fi to do it!

## ðŸ§  Recap

* Computers speak **binary** (just 1s and 0s).
* Denary = regular numbers like 107.
* Use:

  * **Trial and Error**: Build the number using powers of 2.
  * **Successive Division**: Keep dividing by 2, then read remainders bottom to top.
* Either way, 107 = **1101011** in binary.

## Test Your Brain Juice

Letâ€™s see if youâ€™re the next binary beast ðŸ‘¾

1. Use **Trial and Error** to convert **85** to binary.
2. Use **Successive Division** to convert **42** to binary.
3. Whatâ€™s the value of the 5th digit from the right in a binary number?
4. Which method do you prefer and why?
5. Convert **15** to binary using *both* methods. Do you get the same result?
