# 🧙‍♂️ Python Operators: The Python Operator School of Magic 🪄

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/operator.webp" width="100%">

Once upon a code-time, in a world not far from our keyboards, there was a **school for young programmers** called **Pythonopolis**. Every student there learned how to use **magic symbols called "Operators"**. These weren’t wands or potions — no! These were **symbols that gave instructions to computers**.

Each type of operator had a special job to do, and today, you’re about to meet them one by one!

### 🏷️ 1. The Assignment Spell: `=`

Let’s start with young Ada, a clever coder in Pythonopolis.

One day, she picked up a magic chalk and wrote on her scroll:

```python
age = 8
```

The scroll glowed! Ada had used the **assignment operator `=`**, which is like saying: “I give the name `age` to the value `8`.”

It’s like saying: “Hey, computer! From now on, if I say `age`, I mean `8`.”

She could also copy that magic and give it to another scroll:

```python
another_age = age
```

Now both scrolls knew the same secret number!

### ➕➖✖️➗ 2. The Arithmetic Spells

Next, Ada visited the **Math Room**, where all the **arithmetic operators** danced around.

* `+` was the cheerful one who always **added** things together.
* `-` was moody and liked to **take away** things.
* `*` loved to **multiply** things.
* `/` liked to **divide** things equally.

Ada wrote:

```python
cookies = 5 + 3
```

Boom! `cookies` now had the value `8`. Then she tried:

```python
juice = 10 - 4  # juice is 6
cakes = 2 * 3   # cakes is 6
shares = 8 / 2  # shares is 4.0
```

But there were even **more powerful spells**:

* `%` gave her the **leftovers**: `7 % 3` gave `1` (3 goes into 7 twice, with 1 left).
* `**` was a power spell: `2 ** 3` meant `2 × 2 × 2 = 8`.
* `//` was for only the whole part: `7 // 2` gave `3`, not `3.5`.

She could also say:

```python
score = 10
score += 2  # now score is 12!
```

The chalk sparkled with delight!

### 🔍 3. The Comparison Scrolls

One morning, Ada tried comparing scrolls.

She used the **comparison operators** to **ask True or False questions**.

```python
5 == 5  # True
5 != 3  # True
5 > 3   # True
2 < 1   # False
3 >= 3  # True
2 <= 1  # False
```

It was like asking, "Are these numbers the same? Bigger? Smaller?"

If the answer was true, the scroll glowed green. If false, it glowed red.

### 🔮 4. The Boolean Magic Words

Ada discovered three powerful **words** in the logic room:

* `not` – the **flipper**: `not True` became `False`.
* `and` – the **checker**: `True and False` was `False`. Only both True meant True!
* `or` – the **helper**: `True or False` was `True`. As long as one thing was true, the spell worked.

Try this:

```python
sunny = True
warm = False

go_outside = sunny and warm  # False
have_fun = sunny or warm     # True
```

---

### ⚙️ 5. Bitwise and Identity Operators

Now, these were for **advanced magic students**.

* `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` — These were **bitwise tools**, used when talking to computers at the **bit level** (tiny 0s and 1s).
* `is` – asks if two names point to the **same magic object**.
* `in` – checks if something is **inside** a group.

Example:

```python
name = "Ada"
print("d" in name)  # True, because "d" is in "Ada"
```
