# JS REGEX 01: Understanding Regex Flags in JavaScript

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/js-regex-1.jpg" width="100%">

When working with **Regular Expressions (regex)** in JavaScript (and other programming languages), **flags** are optional modifiers that change *how* a pattern behaves. They can make searches case-insensitive, allow multi-line detection, find all matches at once, and more.

Let‚Äôs go through the main regex flags you‚Äôll encounter and understand how each works.

---

## 1. The `g` Flag ‚Äì Global Search

The `g` flag stands for **global search**.
By default, regex stops after the first match. Adding `g` tells it to continue searching for **all occurrences** of the pattern in the text.

**Example:**

```regex
/apples/g
```

This pattern matches **every** occurrence of ‚Äúapples‚Äù in a string.

Without `g`, only the first ‚Äúapples‚Äù would be found.

---

## 2. The `m` Flag ‚Äì Multiline Mode

Normally, regex treats the entire text as a **single line**, so the anchors:

* `^` matches the start of the whole string, and
* `$` matches the end of the whole string.

Adding the `m` flag changes that behavior. In **multiline mode**, `^` and `$` match the **start and end of each line**, not just the whole text.

**Example:**

```regex
/^Roses are red$/gm
```

This matches any line in a multi-line text that exactly says ‚ÄúRoses are red‚Äù.

---

## 3. The `i` Flag ‚Äì Ignore Case

The `i` flag makes regex **case-insensitive**, allowing matches regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.

**Example:**

```regex
/hello/i
```

This will match:

* `hello`
* `Hello`
* `HELLO`
* `HeLLo`

This flag is useful when you want flexible searches that don‚Äôt depend on capitalization.

---

## 4. The `u` Flag ‚Äì Unicode Support

The `u` flag enables **Unicode matching**, allowing regex to properly interpret and work with characters beyond standard ASCII.
This includes emojis, accented letters, and scripts from non-Latin languages.

**Example:**

```regex
/\u{1F600}/u
```

This matches the üòÄ emoji (Unicode U+1F600).

Without the `u` flag, certain Unicode characters may not be recognized correctly.

---

## 5. The `y` Flag ‚Äì Sticky Search

The `y` flag (called the **sticky flag**) makes regex start matching **exactly at the position specified by `lastIndex`**, without skipping ahead.
If there‚Äôs no match at that position, the search fails.

This is particularly useful in JavaScript when parsing structured data or performing controlled incremental searches.

**Example:**

```javascript
const regex = /word/y;
regex.lastIndex = 5;
regex.exec("some word in the middle");
```

Here, the regex engine will only check for ‚Äúword‚Äù starting from index 5. It won‚Äôt look anywhere else.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Summary Table ‚Äì Regex Flags at a Glance

| Flag | Full Name   | Description                                                                          |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `g`  | Global      | Finds **all** matches, not just the first.                                           |
| `m`  | Multiline   | Makes `^` and `$` work for **each line** in multi-line text.                         |
| `i`  | Ignore Case | Makes the search **case-insensitive**.                                               |
| `u`  | Unicode     | Enables proper matching of **Unicode** characters (like emojis or accented letters). |
| `y`  | Sticky      | Matches **only from the current position** (`lastIndex`).                            |

Understanding and combining these flags can significantly improve how you write and control regex patterns.

## üß© Review Fill-Gap Questions

Fill in the blanks to test your understanding:

1. The `___` flag makes the regex look for **all** matches instead of stopping at the first one.
2. To make `^` and `$` detect the start and end of **each line**, use the `___` flag.
3. When you want to match text **without caring about** uppercase or lowercase, use the `___` flag.
4. The `___` flag helps handle **Unicode** characters like emojis or non-English text.
5. When you want a regex that searches **only from its current position**, use the `___` flag.
6. The `g` flag stands for `________`, allowing multiple matches across the string.
7. Without the `m` flag, `^` and `$` only match the start and end of the **entire ________**.
8. To make `/hello/` match ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, and ‚Äúhello‚Äù, you‚Äôd write it as `/hello/___`.
9. The `u` flag is often called the **________ Flag**, because it supports global scripts and symbols.
10. The `y` flag is described as **________**, because it only matches from its last known position.
