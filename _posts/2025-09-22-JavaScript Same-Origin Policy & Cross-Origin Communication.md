# 🌍 JavaScript Same-Origin Policy & Cross-Origin Communication

Imagine you’re at **Yaba Tech** library in Lagos. You borrow a locker to keep your books safe. The rule says:

* Only **your locker key** can open **your locker**.
* You cannot use your key to open someone else’s locker.

This rule keeps people’s belongings separate and secure.

On the web, browsers use a similar rule called the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**. It’s one of the most important security features in the internet world.

## 🔑 What is the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)?

* The **Same-Origin Policy** is a security rule in browsers.
* It says: **A web page can only access data from the same origin (domain, protocol, and port) that it was loaded from.**

👉 In simple terms:

* A page from `https://mysite.com` cannot freely access data from `https://othersite.com`.

---

### 🏗 What is an “Origin”?

An origin is defined by **3 parts**:

1. **Protocol** → `http://` or `https://`
2. **Domain (host)** → e.g., `example.com`
3. **Port** → e.g., `:80`, `:443`

So:

* `https://example.com:443` → one origin
* `http://example.com:80` → different origin (because protocol differs)
* `https://sub.example.com:443` → different origin (because domain differs)

---

## ⚡ Why Do We Need SOP?

Think of SOP as **a security wall**. Without it:

* If you’re logged into your bank at `bank.com`, a malicious page at `evil.com` could steal your bank balance directly.
* SOP prevents `evil.com` from reaching into `bank.com`’s locker.

---

## 🔒 What SOP Restricts

By default, one origin **cannot**:

* Read cookies or localStorage from another origin.
* Make AJAX requests and read responses from another origin.
* Access the DOM of a page from another origin (e.g., an `<iframe>`).

---

## 🛠️ When Cross-Origin Communication is Needed

But sometimes, you actually **need** to share data across origins. Example:

* Your site `shop.com` wants to use an API from `payments.com`.
* Or your web app loads fonts, videos, or images from a CDN (`cdn.com`).

That’s where **Cross-Origin Communication** comes in.

---

## 🔑 Techniques for Cross-Origin Communication

### 1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

* The server at `api.example.com` can set special headers like:

  ```http
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mysite.com
  ```
* This tells the browser: “It’s okay, let `mysite.com` access me.”
* Without CORS, browsers block the request.

---

### 2. **JSONP (Old Way)**

* Before CORS, developers used JSONP: loading cross-domain data by injecting a `<script>` tag.
* Example:

  ```html
  <script src="https://api.example.com/data?callback=myFunction"></script>
  ```
* This was clever but insecure, and today it’s mostly replaced by CORS.

---

### 3. **PostMessage (for iframes & windows)**

* If your site uses an `<iframe>` or a popup from another origin, you can communicate safely with:

  ```js
  otherWindow.postMessage("Hello", "https://trusted.com");
  ```
* And the receiving window listens with:

  ```js
  window.addEventListener("message", event => {
    console.log("Got message:", event.data);
  });
  ```
* This way, you can exchange messages between different origins securely.

---

### 4. **Proxy Servers**

* Your site can send requests to its own server, and the server forwards them to the external API.
* Example:

  * Browser → `mysite.com/api` → Server → `othersite.com`
* This way, the browser only talks to the **same origin**, and the server handles cross-origin logic.

---

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

* CORS must be configured carefully — never allow `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for sensitive data.
* PostMessage should always check `event.origin` to ensure the message comes from a trusted site.
* JSONP is dangerous and rarely recommended today.
* SOP itself is not a weakness — it’s a **protection**. The challenge is: developers must use the right tools when cross-origin communication is actually needed.

---

## ✅ Summary in Simple Words

* **Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** A rule that stops one site from messing with another’s data.
* An **origin** = protocol + domain + port.
* By default, SOP blocks cross-origin access for safety.
* When cross-origin communication is needed, developers use **CORS, PostMessage, or Proxy servers**.
* Security is all about balance: protect users but allow safe sharing when required.

## 📝 Review – Fill in the Gaps

1. SOP stands for **Same \_\_\_\_\_\_ Policy**.
2. An origin is defined by protocol, domain, and \_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. By default, a page from one origin cannot read another site’s \_\_\_\_\_\_ or localStorage.
4. SOP prevents malicious sites from stealing your data, like your \_\_\_\_\_\_ balance.
5. To allow safe cross-origin requests, servers use \_\_\_\_\_\_ headers.
6. The modern standard for cross-origin communication is \_\_\_\_\_\_ (not JSONP).
7. JSONP worked by adding a `<script>` tag but is considered \_\_\_\_\_\_ today.
8. To send messages between windows or iframes, developers use the \_\_\_\_\_\_ API.
9. A server can act as a \_\_\_\_\_\_ to forward requests to another origin.
10. Developers must carefully check the origin in `postMessage` to avoid \_\_\_\_\_\_ attacks.
