# üí¨ Google Apps Script: Creating a Modal Dialog in Google Docs

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-apps-script-education.jpg" width="100%">

Imagine you‚Äôre creating an Add-on that needs the user‚Äôs full attention ‚Äî maybe to confirm an action, display a warning, or collect some data before they continue.
You don‚Äôt want them clicking around the document while this message is showing, right?

That‚Äôs where the **modal dialog** comes in.

Unlike a sidebar (which politely sits to the side), a modal dialog takes center stage. It *locks the background* ‚Äî meaning the user can‚Äôt edit or type in the document until they close it. It‚Äôs the perfect tool when you need undivided attention.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Update the Script Code

We‚Äôll use the same HTML file (`Index.html`) you created earlier.
Now, let‚Äôs update the `Code.gs` file to include the modal dialog logic.

Here‚Äôs the code:

```javascript
function onOpen() {
  DocumentApp.getUi()
    .createAddonMenu()
    .addItem("Show Dialog", "showDialog")
    .addToUi();
}

function showDialog() {
  var html = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index');
  DocumentApp.getUi().showModalDialog(html, 'Greeting');
}
```

Simple, clean, and elegant.

## üß† Let‚Äôs Break It Down

Let‚Äôs understand what each piece of this script is doing:

* **`onOpen()`** ‚Äî This function runs automatically whenever your Google Doc (or Sheet) opens. It adds a new menu option under your Add-ons tab called **‚ÄúShow Dialog.‚Äù**

* **`createAddonMenu()`** ‚Äî This method creates the Add-on menu itself.

* **`addItem("Show Dialog", "showDialog")`** ‚Äî This line adds a clickable item to the menu. When a user clicks **Show Dialog**, it triggers the **showDialog()** function.

* **`showDialog()`** ‚Äî This function creates the dialog box itself.

  * First, it loads your **Index.html** file using `HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index')`.
  * Then, it uses `showModalDialog()` to display that HTML as a **blocking dialog box** titled *‚ÄúGreeting.‚Äù*

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Run and Test It

Now it‚Äôs time to see your modal in action!

1. Save your script.
2. Run the `onOpen()` function (or just reload the document).
3. Go to the **Add-ons menu ‚Üí Chapter 2 ‚Üí Show Dialog**.

And voil√† ‚Äî your modal dialog pops up front and center, with your ‚ÄúClick Me‚Äù button from the HTML file sitting proudly inside it.

Try clicking the button ‚Äî it should still say ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù
Notice something? You can‚Äôt click anywhere else in the document until you close that dialog. That‚Äôs the magic of a **modal** interface.

---

## üé® Step 3: Understanding When to Use It

Use a modal dialog when you want the user‚Äôs full focus. Examples include:

* Confirming before deleting or submitting data
* Displaying important messages or warnings
* Collecting short form input (like a name or feedback)
* Guiding users through a one-time setup

If you just want to show information alongside their document ‚Äî like an ongoing dashboard or form ‚Äî use a **sidebar** instead.

But when your message is critical and non-ignorable, the **modal dialog** is your hero.

---

## üß© Step 4: Customizing Your Dialog

You can make your modal more appealing by adding custom HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript inside your `Index.html` file. For instance:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <base target="_top">
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 20px;
      }
      button {
        background-color: royalblue;
        color: white;
        border: none;
        padding: 10px 20px;
        border-radius: 8px;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
      button:hover {
        background-color: dodgerblue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Hello, Friend!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to your custom Google Docs Add-on dialog.</p>
    <button onclick="google.script.host.close()">Close Dialog</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now when you run your dialog, it feels like a real mini-app inside Google Docs.
