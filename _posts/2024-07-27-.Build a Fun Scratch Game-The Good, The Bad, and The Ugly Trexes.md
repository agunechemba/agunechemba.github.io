# Build a Fun Scratch Game: “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Trexes”

If you're new to Scratch and looking for a fun way to learn core programming concepts, this simple game project is a great place to start! In *“The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly Trexes,”* you’ll guide a cat sprite through a lively forest, dodging dangerous dinosaurs while trying to gain extra lives from a friendly one.

Here’s what the game involves:

* 🟢 **The Good T-Rex (Green)**: Touch it to gain a life.
* 🔴 **The Ugly T-Rex (Red)** & ⚫ **The Bad T-Rex (Gray)**: Avoid them! They cost you lives.

The tutorial walks you through:

* Creating and duplicating sprites
* Color-coding enemies and friends
* Using arrow keys to move the cat sprite
* Coding interactions using a **“lives”** variable
* Making enemies move randomly and bounce off edges
* Adding a timer to measure survival time
* Triggering a **“Game Over”** message when lives hit zero
* Designing the game with a forest background for visual appeal

This project is a hands-on way to introduce learners to variables, control structures, and event handling in Scratch. Plus, you’ll be encouraged to get creative—add sounds, design new levels, or even animate the sprites!
