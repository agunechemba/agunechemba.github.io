> *“You were born for this.”*
> That’s what I often whisper to myself now. But there was a time I wasn’t so sure.

I was born on **July 28th**, and for many years, it was just another day. Cake. Laughter. Maybe some jollof rice and music. But these days, when I look at the calendar, that date stirs something deeper. It reminds me how far I’ve come — not just as a tech trainer, but as a boy who once stared at a dusty Toshiba laptop with 512MB RAM, wondering if he could ever do anything that mattered.

I didn’t come from Silicon Valley. I came from **Lagos**, where Wi-Fi wasn’t free, and computer labs were rare. But I had something stronger than access: I had hunger. The kind of hunger that made me Google HTML tags at midnight. That made me wait for slow Visafone connections just to open a tutorial. That made me say *yes* to teaching, even when I was still learning myself.

Somehow, that hunger turned into **Firstac Academy**. Then **Pepe Programming Hub**. Then physical classes at **Clasam Schools**. Then learners from the UK, the US, the streets of Idimu — all logging in to learn from that same boy who once edited photos on Photoshop after being trained by a photographer called **Award Photos**.

But here’s the truth:
**It’s not about code. It’s about connection.**
It’s about helping a child see the magic behind a blinking cursor. It’s about watching someone’s confidence grow with every line of JavaScript. It’s about using tech to heal, to inspire, and to dream.

Today, as I turn a year older, I don’t just celebrate age.
I celebrate **impact**.

To my non-tech followers: Thank you for cheering me on, even when you didn’t know what I was building.
To my tech friends: Thank you for challenging me, pushing me, and coding alongside me.

And to the 15-year-old version of me:
You did it, boy.
You’re doing it still.
And we’re not done yet.
