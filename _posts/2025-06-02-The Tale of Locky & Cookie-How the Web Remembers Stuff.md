**Hello, coder!**
Today, I have a fun little story to tell you — about two clever helpers who live inside your browser. Their names? **Locky** and **Cookie**.

They work hard behind the scenes to **remember things** for you when you're visiting websites.

Ready to meet them? Let’s go! 🚀

---

## 🧑🏽‍💻 Meet Locky the Locker (aka `localStorage`)

Once upon a time in BrowserPalace, there was a helper named **Locky**. He looked like a big digital **locker** where you could keep your stuff — like your favorite color, your game score, or your website theme (dark or light).

Locky’s job was simple:

> “I’ll remember things *only on this computer* — even if you leave and come back later!”

He’s fast, strong, and doesn’t bother anyone. But he has one rule:

> “I *never* go to the office (the server). I stay right here with you!”

## 🍪 Meet Cookie the Messenger

Then there’s **Cookie**, a tiny but powerful helper. She’s like a message that’s written on a **sticky note** and carried to the **teacher’s office** (the server) every time you walk into class (open a page).

> “Hey server, remember this student? Her name is Alice!”

Cookie may be small, but she’s very important. She helps websites know who you are, if you’re logged in, or what page you were last on.

## 🤔 So, What’s the Difference Between Locky and Cookie?

Let’s imagine our website is a **school**...

| Feature                 | Locky the Locker 💾                                           | Cookie the Note 🍪                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lives where?**        | In your **browser locker**                                    | In your **browser**, but travels to the **server**               |
| **Size**                | Big and strong — up to **5MB–10MB**!                          | Tiny — only **about 4KB**                                        |
| **Expires?**            | Nope. He remembers things **forever** (unless you clear them) | Yes, she can be told, “Forget this after 1 hour.”                |
| **Goes to the server?** | Never. He stays at school.                                    | Always. She walks to the office with **every request**           |
| **Best at**             | Remembering settings, themes, scores, notes                   | Remembering logins, sessions, and telling the server who you are |

## 🖍️ Let’s Play with Them!

### 🧪 Locky’s Code

Want to store something in Locky’s locker? Here’s how you do it:

```
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
```

Boom! You just told Locky:

> “Hey, remember that I like dark mode!”

Later, you can ask him:

```
let theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
```

He’ll reply,

> “Dark!”

### 🧪 Cookie’s Code

Now, let’s give Cookie a note to carry:

```
document.cookie = "username=Alice; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2025 12:00:00 UTC;";
```

Now every time you visit a new page on the same website, Cookie will say:

> “The user’s name is Alice!”

The server can use that note to say,

> “Welcome back, Alice!”

## 🧠 Who Does What?

Here’s a quick guide so you never forget:

| You want to...                     | Use this  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| Remember game scores or settings   | Locky 💾  |
| Stay logged into a website         | Cookie 🍪 |
