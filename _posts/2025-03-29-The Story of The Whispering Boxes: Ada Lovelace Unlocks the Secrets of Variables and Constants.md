## The Story of The Whispering Boxes: Ada Lovelace Unlocks the Secrets of Variables and Constants

In a world where wizards controlled the fabric of reality with code, Ada Lovelace, the world’s first computer programmer, sat with her mentor, Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine.

Charles presented Ada with a mysterious box. “This is the Box of Variables,” he said. “It can hold anything you desire, but you must give it a name and tell it what to hold.”

Ada’s eyes sparkled as she opened the box. Inside, she found a small piece of paper with the word “x” written on it.

“What does it mean?” Ada asked.

“Ah,” Charles replied, “the ‘x’ represents the box’s contents. You can assign any value to ‘x’, and the box will hold it. But remember, once you assign a new value, the old one is gone.”

Ada’s curiosity was piqued. She decided to assign the value “Bernoulli numbers” to the box, referencing her work on the Analytical Engine’s ability to calculate these complex numbers.

x = Bernoulli numbers
As she spoke the words, the box began to glow, and a series of numbers appeared inside.

Ada beamed with excitement. “I did it!”

But then, she had an idea. “What if I want the box to hold something else?”

Charles smiled. “Simple. Just reassign the value.”

Ada thought for a moment before speaking:

x = music notes
The box glowed once more, and the Bernoulli numbers disappeared, replaced by a musical composition.


Ada grasped the concept. “A variable is like this magic box! It can hold different values, and I can change what’s inside by reassigning it.”

Charles nodded, proud of his protégée. “Exactly, Ada. Your work on the Analytical Engine, including your method for calculating Bernoulli numbers, has shown the true potential of variables in programming.”

**The Immutable Values: Unlocking the Secrets of Constants**

As they continued to explore the world of variables, Charles introduced Ada to another concept: constants.

“Ada, imagine a magical box that can only hold one thing, and once it’s set, it can never be changed,” Charles explained.

Ada’s curiosity was piqued. “What’s the point of such a box?” she asked.

Charles smiled. “Ah, but that’s where the power of constants lies. You see, constants are like these special boxes that hold a value that never changes. Once you set it, it remains the same throughout your entire program.”

Ada thought for a moment. “So, constants are like variables, but I can only assign a value to them once?”

Charles nodded. “Exactly! And that’s what makes constants so useful. They help you define values that shouldn’t be changed, like the number of notes in a musical scale.”

Ada’s eyes widened as she grasped the concept. “I see! So, variables are like the magic boxes that can hold different values, while constants are like the special boxes that hold a single, unchanging value.”

Charles beamed with pride. “You’ve got it, Ada! Your work on the Analytical Engine, and your insights into variables and constants, will forever change the world of computing.”

And so, Ada Lovelace continued to weave her magic, using variables and constants to create innovative programs that would inspire generations to come.

## Review Questions

1.  imagine you have a special toy box. you can put any toy you want in it. Let's say you first put a teddy bear in. Now, if you want to put a car in, you take the teddy bear out, and the car goes in. The box can hold different things at different times. What could this toy box be like in computer coding?

2.  Now, imagine another special box. Once you put your favorite block inside, you can never take it out, and you can never put anything else in. It stays the same forever. What could this never-changing box be like in computer coding? Can you think of something that should always stay the same, like the number of fingers on one hand?

3.  Let's say your first toy box is called "number of cookies." First, you put in the number 5. Then, you eat two cookies. How would you change what's in the "number of cookies" box?

4.  Think about a game you like. Is there anything in that game that never changes, no matter what you do? What is it? Why is it important that it stays the same?

5.  If you have one toy box for the length of a table and another toy box for how wide it is, how could you figure out how much space the table takes up? Would the answer (how much space) be something that can change, or would it stay the same once you figure it out?
