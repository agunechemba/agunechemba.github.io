### An IGCSE Computer Science Lesson — Told as a Story

---

## 🎙️ Once Upon a Flow\...

In the pixelated kingdom of **Techland**, lived a brave and clever adventurer known as **Captain Flowchart**.

But Captain Flowchart didn’t sail ships or fight dragons. His job? Giving instructions to a team of robots who couldn't read words or understand speech. The only thing they could follow were **maps made of steps** — pictures that told them what to do, one action at a time.

To help the robots complete their missions — like finding lost treasure or baking digital cookies — Captain Flowchart drew out all the steps in diagrams. These diagrams were called **flowcharts**.

## 🧠 What Is a Flowchart?

Just like a treasure map guides explorers to gold, a **flowchart** is a diagram that guides someone (or a computer!) through solving a problem step by step.

Think of it this way:
💡 **An algorithm** is a *set of instructions*. A **flowchart** is the *picture* of those instructions.

You’ve already followed algorithms in real life:

* Making tea 🍵
* Getting dressed 👕
* Brushing your teeth 🪥
* Playing a game 🎮

The difference? With flowcharts, we draw these steps using **symbols** — kind of like emoji for instructions!

## 🔣 Meet the Flowchart Symbols

In Techland, Captain Flowchart uses **special shapes** to represent different types of actions.

Here’s his toolkit:

| 🧩 Symbol    | 💬 Name    | ✨ Meaning                                           |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔷 Oval      | Terminator | Shows where the journey **starts** or **ends**      |
| 🔲 Rectangle | Process    | An **action** like “pick up spoon” or “brush teeth” |
| 🔷 Diamond   | Decision   | A **yes/no question** like “Is it raining?”         |
| ➡️ Arrow     | Flowline   | Tells the robot **which step to go to next**        |

Captain Flowchart says:

> “If it’s shaped like a diamond, I’m making a decision. If it’s a rectangle, I’m doing something!”

## ☂️ Sample Mission: Should I Bring an Umbrella?

Let’s follow Captain Flowchart on a quick adventure.

**Mission:** Decide whether to bring an umbrella.

Flowchart logic:

* Start
* Is it raining?

  * If **yes**, bring an umbrella
  * If **no**, go outside without one
* End

That’s it! A simple flowchart can solve everyday decisions.

## ✍🏽 Your Turn: Brush Like a Pro

Now let’s hand the map-making over to *you*, our young Techland explorers!

🎯 **Challenge:** Create a flowchart for brushing your teeth.

Suggested steps:

* Start
* Pick up toothbrush
* Apply toothpaste
* Brush for 2 minutes
* Rinse mouth
* Put toothbrush back
* End

Try sketching it using the correct symbols. Think like Captain Flowchart — what shape goes where?

## 🔁 Bonus Challenge: The Vending Machine

Ready for a tougher quest?

> **Design a flowchart for a vending machine.**
>
> The machine should give you a drink **only if you insert the correct amount of money**.

What decisions would it make? What actions would it take? Can you make it smart and fair?
