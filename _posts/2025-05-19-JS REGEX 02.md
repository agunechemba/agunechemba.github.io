# JS REGEX 02: Using Regular Expressions (RegEx) for Form Validation in Web Development

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/js-regex-1.jpg" width="100%">

In web development, form validation is one of the most important tasks you’ll ever handle. Before a user’s information can be submitted, you often need to make sure they’ve entered it **in the right format** — whether it’s an **email address**, **phone number**, or **password**.

Instead of writing long chains of `if` statements or checking strings one piece at a time, developers rely on **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** — a short, powerful way to **search**, **match**, and **validate** text according to well-defined patterns.

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use RegEx to validate three common input types: **Email**, **Nigerian Phone Numbers**, and **Passwords**.

## 📧 Validating Email Addresses

Email validation is one of the most common uses of RegEx.
A typical email address follows this format:

```
username@domain.extension
```

It has four key parts:

* A **username** (letters, numbers, or symbols like `_` or `.`)
* The **@** symbol separating the username from the domain
* A **domain name**
* A **top-level domain** like `.com`, `.org`, or `.ng`

Here’s the RegEx pattern used to validate an email:

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

Let’s break it down:

* The `^` symbol marks the **start** of the string.
* `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` allows letters, numbers, and some special symbols before the `@`.
* The `@` ensures that symbol is present.
* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` captures the **domain** part (like `gmail` or `yahoo`).
* The `\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` checks that the extension (like `.com` or `.ng`) has at least two letters.
* And finally, `$` marks the **end** of the string.

So, `me@gmail.com` or `user@site.ng` would both be valid, while something like `myemail` or `user@site` would not.
This pattern ensures that only properly structured email addresses pass your validation.

## ☎️ Validating Nigerian Phone Numbers

Now, let’s look at Nigerian phone numbers.
They usually start with specific prefixes and must contain **exactly 11 digits**.
The common prefixes include: `070`, `080`, `081`, `090`, and `091`.

The RegEx pattern for that looks like this:

```regex
^(070|080|081|090|091)\d{8}$
```

Here’s what happens step-by-step:

* The `^` again marks the beginning of the string.
* The group `(070|080|081|090|091)` ensures the number starts with one of the approved Nigerian prefixes.
* `\d{8}` means there must be **exactly eight digits** after that prefix.
* The `$` marks the end of the number, confirming it stops right after those 11 digits.

So, a number like `08012345678` or `09187654321` passes validation perfectly.
But `0811234567` (missing one digit) or `0145678901` (invalid prefix) would fail immediately.

This simple RegEx keeps your form from accepting fake or wrongly formatted Nigerian mobile numbers.

## 🔐 Validating Password Strength

Next, let’s talk about password validation — something every serious web application must handle.
A strong password should have at least:

* One lowercase letter
* One uppercase letter
* One number
* One special character (such as `@`, `$`, `!`, `%`, `*`, `?`, or `&`)
* And it should be at least **8 characters long**.

Here’s a powerful RegEx pattern for that:

```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
```

Now let’s explain the magic:

* `(?=.*[a-z])` ensures there’s at least one lowercase letter.
* `(?=.*[A-Z])` ensures there’s at least one uppercase letter.
* `(?=.*\d)` ensures at least one number.
* `(?=.*[@$!%*?&])` ensures there’s at least one special character.
* `[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}` finally checks that the total length is **eight characters or more**.

So, `Pa$$w0rd!` passes with flying colors.
But something like `Pass123` (too short) or `password` (no number or uppercase) would fail.

This pattern helps you enforce password strength effortlessly — no long condition chains needed.

## 💡 Why Use RegEx for Validation?

You *could* validate inputs with several `if` statements, but that quickly becomes messy and hard to maintain.

For example, you might write:

```javascript
if (!email.includes("@")) { ... }
if (phone.length !== 11) { ... }
if (!passwordHasNumber) { ... }
```

That’s fine for very basic checks, but it can get confusing when your logic grows.
RegEx, on the other hand, lets you handle all of that in one clean line of code per field:

```javascript
emailPattern.test(email);
phonePattern.test(phone);
passwordPattern.test(password);
```

It’s shorter, cleaner, and much easier to adjust later.
You can instantly see what the pattern checks for and expand it without cluttering your code.

## 🧠 Quick Recap

Let’s recap the patterns we used:

* **Email:** `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`
  Checks for the general format `username@domain.extension`.

* **Nigerian Phone Number:** `^(070|080|081|090|091)\d{8}$`
  Ensures it starts with a valid prefix and contains 11 digits.

* **Password:** `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&]).{8,}$`
  Confirms the password is strong and secure.

With these three patterns, you can handle most validation tasks for sign-up forms, login pages, and online registrations like a pro.
