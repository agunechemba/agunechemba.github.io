# JS REGEX 02: Validating User Inputs with Regular Expressions in Web Forms

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/an_illustration_of_a_nigerian_web_developer.jpeg" width="100%">

Once upon a time in the world of web development, a young developer was tasked with building a **sign-up form** for users in Nigeria. It looked simple — just fields for **Email**, **Phone Number**, and **Password** — but there was a hidden challenge: how do you make sure users enter the *right kind of data*?

That’s when our hero discovered a magical tool called **RegEx (Regular Expression)** — a compact yet powerful language used to **search**, **match**, and **validate** text.

Think of RegEx as a **smart filter** that checks if a piece of text follows a specific rule. It doesn’t just look at the surface; it *analyzes* patterns and says either ✅ “This fits!” or ❌ “No, that’s wrong.”

Let’s take a storytelling journey into how you, as a developer, can wield RegEx to keep your forms clean, secure, and professional.

## 🧠 The Mission: Data Validation in a Nigerian Sign-up Form

Imagine this — you’re building a registration form for an online platform. You need to collect:

1. **Email Address**
2. **Phone Number** (in Nigerian format)
3. **Password**

Your mission? Ensure that every user provides **complete, correct, and secure** data before submission. Let’s explore how RegEx saves the day.

## 📧 1. Validating Email Addresses

Emails follow a global pattern — something like `someone@example.com`. It’s structured with three main parts:

* A **username** before the `@`
* A **domain** name after the `@`
* A **top-level domain** (like `.com`, `.org`, or `.ng`)

### ✅ RegEx Pattern:

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
```

### 🧩 How It Works:

* `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` → Matches the part **before** the `@`, allowing letters, numbers, and symbols like `_` or `.`
* `@` → Ensures there’s an **@ symbol** separating the name from the domain
* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` → Matches the **domain name**
* `\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` → Ensures a **dot followed by at least two letters** for the domain extension

### 🧪 Examples:

| Input          | Result | Explanation                 |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `myemail`      | ❌      | Missing `@` and domain name |
| `me@gmail.com` | ✅      | Valid email format          |
| `user@site.ng` | ✅      | Valid `.ng` domain          |

This RegEx ensures that users enter a properly formatted email before submitting your form.

## ☎️ 2. Validating Nigerian Phone Numbers

Nigerian phone numbers have a predictable format: they begin with one of a few specific prefixes (`070`, `080`, `081`, `090`, or `091`) and always contain **11 digits total**.

### ✅ RegEx Pattern:

```regex
^(070|080|081|090|091)\d{8}$
```

### 🧩 How It Works:

* `^` → Start of the string
* `(070|080|081|090|091)` → Accepts any of these prefixes
* `\d{8}` → Requires exactly **8 digits** after the prefix
* `$` → End of the string

### 🧪 Examples:

| Input         | Result | Explanation                       |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `08012345678` | ✅      | Valid Nigerian number             |
| `0811234567`  | ❌      | Only 10 digits, one missing       |
| `09187654321` | ✅      | Valid and complete                |
| `0145678901`  | ❌      | Invalid prefix (`01` not allowed) |

This pattern ensures your platform accepts only authentic Nigerian numbers.

## 🔐 3. Validating Password Strength

Passwords are like castle gates — they must be strong enough to keep intruders out. Your rules are:

* At least **8 characters** long
* Must contain **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
* Must include **a number**
* Must have **a special symbol** like `@, $, !, %, *, ?, &`

### ✅ RegEx Pattern:

```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
```

### 🧩 How It Works:

* `(?=.*[a-z])` → At least one **lowercase** letter
* `(?=.*[A-Z])` → At least one **uppercase** letter
* `(?=.*\d)` → At least one **digit**
* `(?=.*[@$!%*?&])` → At least one **special character**
* `{8,}` → Minimum length of **8 characters**

### 🧪 Examples:

| Input       | Valid? | Why                          |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `password`  | ❌      | Weak — no numbers or symbols |
| `Pass123`   | ❌      | Too short (less than 8)      |
| `Pa$$w0rd!` | ✅      | Strong and meets all rules   |

With this pattern, you can instantly verify password strength and reject weak submissions.

## 💡 Why Use RegEx Instead of Long `if` Statements?

Sure, you could write a dozen `if` conditions like:

```javascript
if (!email.includes("@")) { ... }
if (phone.length !== 11) { ... }
if (!passwordHasNumber) { ... }
```

But that gets **messy** and **hard to maintain**.

RegEx compresses all those rules into **one elegant line**, making your validation cleaner, faster, and more professional.

It’s like using one magic spell instead of twenty tiny checks.

| Field            | Purpose                             | Example RegEx                                          |     |     |     |             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| **Email**        | Ensures proper email format         | `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`     |     |     |     |             |
| **Phone Number** | Validates 11-digit Nigerian numbers | `^(070                                                 | 080 | 081 | 090 | 091)\d{8}$` |
| **Password**     | Enforces strong password rules      | `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&]).{8,}$` |     |     |     |             |

RegEx doesn’t just save time — it makes your forms smarter and your users safer.
