What if learning math felt like playing a game at a sports arena? That idea led to the creation of the **Tug Of War Math Game** — a two-player touch-screen experience where learning meets competition.

The concept is simple but powerful. Two players face off by solving random math questions. Every correct answer pulls the rope closer to their side, creating a real tug-of-war battle on screen. The faster and more accurate you are, the closer you get to winning.

The game was built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canvas**, making it lightweight, fast, and perfect for smart boards, classrooms, and interactive kiosks. Large tap-friendly buttons ensure smooth gameplay on touch screens, especially for kids.

Beyond gameplay, the goal is impact — making math less intimidating and more exciting through play, visuals, and friendly competition.

This project is part of my ongoing work in building interactive digital experiences that educate, engage, and entertain.
