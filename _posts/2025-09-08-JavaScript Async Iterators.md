### Imagine Watching a YouTube Playlist

Think about when you watch a YouTube playlist.

* Normally, if all the videos are already downloaded, you can just play one after another right away.
* But if some videos need to **buffer** (load from the internet), you have to wait a little before the next one plays.

That‚Äôs what **Async Iterators** do in JavaScript. They let you loop through a list of things, but instead of getting them instantly, you can **wait for each item as it arrives**.

---

### **Normal Iterators**

An **iterator** is just a way to go through items one by one.
Example:

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

Here, all numbers are ready immediately.

### **Async Iterators**

But what if the items take time to arrive (like data from a server)?
That‚Äôs when **async iterators** are useful. They let you loop with **`for await...of`** and **wait** for each item.

Example:

```
async function* asyncGenerator() {
    yield "First piece of data";
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    yield "Second piece of data";
}

(async () => {
    for await (let item of asyncGenerator()) {
        console.log(item);
    }
})();
```

Output:

```
First piece of data
(wait 1 second)
Second piece of data
```

### **Why is this useful?**

Async Iterators are perfect when:

* Data comes in chunks (like streaming a video or downloading files).
* You want to process items **one at a time** as they arrive.
* You don‚Äôt want to wait for everything to finish before starting.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of **Async Iterators** like eating a meal at a restaurant üçΩÔ∏è:

* The waiter brings your food in courses (starter, main, dessert).
* You don‚Äôt wait for the entire meal to be cooked before starting.
* You enjoy each dish as soon as it arrives.

---

### **In Short**

* Iterators = get items one by one (all ready now).
* Async Iterators = get items one by one (but each may take time to arrive).
* Use **`for await...of`** to handle them.

### **Review Questions**

1. An iterator lets you go through items \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. A normal iterator gives you items \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. An async iterator gives you items that may arrive \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. The special loop used with async iterators is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
5. In async iterators, the keyword \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is used to produce values one at a time.
6. Async iterators are useful when data comes in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, like video streams.
7. A real-life analogy for async iterators is eating a meal served in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
8. The opposite of async iterators, normal iterators provide data \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
9. In an async generator, we can pause with the keyword \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ before yielding the next value.
10. Async iterators prevent programs from waiting for everything at once by processing items as they \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
