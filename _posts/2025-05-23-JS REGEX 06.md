# JS REGEX 06: JavaScript’s Secret Finders — `.test()`, `.exec()`, and `.match()`

Imagine you’re a **word detective**, holding three special magnifying glasses.
Each glass helps you **find hidden words or letters** inside sentences — but each one works a little differently.

Today, we’ll meet our three heroes:

* 🕵️ **`.test()`** — the quick yes/no detective
* 🧠 **`.exec()`** — the deep-diving investigator
* 🔍 **`.match()`** — the friendly helper that works from the string side

Ready? Let’s investigate! 🚀

## 🧪 1. `.test()` – “Is it there?”

Sometimes, you just want a **simple answer**:
👉 “Does this word appear in the sentence or not?”

That’s where `.test()` comes in!

```js
var re = /cat/;
console.log(re.test("The cat is here"));  // true
console.log(re.test("No animal here"));   // false
```

`.test()` gives you a **boolean**:

* `true` → if it finds a match
* `false` → if it doesn’t

It’s the **quickest** of the three — no extra info, no fuss.
Think of it like asking a guard: “Do you see a cat here?”
He simply nods yes or shakes his head no. 🐈

## 📦 2. `.exec()` – “Tell me *everything!*”

Now, let’s say you don’t just want to know **if** the word is there —
you also want to know **where** it was found and **what part** matched.

That’s what `.exec()` does. It gives you a **whole report**!

```js
var re = /c(at)/;
var result = re.exec("The cat is here");

console.log(result[0]);      // "cat"  → the full match
console.log(result[1]);      // "at"   → captured group
console.log(result.index);   // 4      → position in the sentence
```

See how `.exec()` gives details? It’s like a detective who brings back:

> “I found the word ‘cat’ at position 4, and I also noticed the letters ‘at’ inside it!”

It even works beautifully with loops when used with `/g` for global searches.
It’s precise, methodical, and very detailed — perfect for **pattern detectives**.

## 🔁 3. `.match()` – “Search it from the string side!”

Finally, `.match()` is a bit like `.exec()` — but instead of being called **from the regex**, it’s called **from the string** itself!

Let’s see it in action:

```js
var sentence = "The cat is here";
var result = sentence.match(/cat/);

console.log(result[0]); // "cat"
```

Nice and simple!
But when you want to find *all* matches, you can use the **`g` flag**:

```js
var str = "cat, bat, hat";
console.log(str.match(/at/g));  // ["at", "at", "at"]
```

So `.match()` is your go-to tool when you just want a **list of all the matches** quickly.

## 📚 Summary – The Detective Trio

| 🔍 Goal                           | 🧰 Tool to Use | 🪄 What It Returns               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Just check if there’s a match     | `.test()`      | `true` or `false`                |
| Get full match info and groups    | `.exec()`      | Array with full match + details  |
| Find matches from a string easily | `.match()`     | Single match or array of matches |

Each one is powerful — but the real magic happens when you know *which to use when!* 🌟

## 💡 Quick Analogy

Imagine you’re at a treasure hunt:

* `.test()` just says, “Yes, treasure is here!”
* `.exec()` digs it up and gives you the coordinates!
* `.match()` lists all treasures in one glance!

That’s how regex turns you into a **text-finding superhero**! 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️

## 🧩 Review – Fill in the Gaps

Now, let’s check how sharp your detective skills are!
Fill in the missing words to complete these sentences. ✍️

1. The `.test()` method returns either `______` or `______`.
2. `.exec()` provides detailed match information like the full match, captured groups, and the match `______`.
3. To search for all matches, you add the `______` flag to your regular expression.
4. The method `.match()` is called on the `______`, not the regex.
5. `.test()` is best when you only need a simple `______` or `______` answer.
6. The captured parts of a regex can be accessed inside `.exec()` using bracket notation like `result[______]`.
7. When `.exec()` finds a match, it returns an array; if no match, it returns `______`.
8. The `.match()` method can return an `______` of all found matches when used with the global flag.
9. The property `result.index` tells you where the `______` started in the string.
10. All three — `.test()`, `.exec()`, and `.match()` — are used to `______` for patterns inside strings.
