I recently had the incredible opportunity to work on the website for **Avi Cenna Schools** ([https://avi-cenna.com](https://avi-cenna.com/)), and I wanted to share a bit about the journey.

The project came to me through my mentor, **Dr. Olutimo**, who was genuinely surprised by the speed and quality of what I delivered. In less than **one hour**, I managed to produce a fully functional, visually appealing website—not using pre-made templates, but **raw code**, written from scratch and refined with the help of **ChatGPT** (not premium!).

What makes this experience exciting isn’t just the speed, but the ability to take an idea and bring it to life with clean, original code. It’s a testament to how far web development has come and how AI tools can enhance the creative process.

I’m still actively building and refining the website, but I’m looking forward to sharing the final version soon. If you’d like to follow the progress, you can check it out here: [https://agunechemba.name.ng/Avi-Cenna](https://agunechemba.name.ng/Avi-Cenna/).

Stay tuned—I’ll be posting the complete project once it’s ready.
