# The Tech Trainer's Dilemma: Am I Falling Behind?

It’s a fact many of us know. I’m a tech trainer, and I love what I do. I get to help young learners and adults learn to code, and I have students all over the world who stick with me. But then I talk to my friends—the ones who are software developers. They’re making more money, working on big projects, and climbing a career ladder that looks more traditional.

In those moments, a voice in my head whispers, *"Are you doing the right thing? Are you lagging behind?"* It’s a classic case of comparing my path to theirs, and it’s something I’ve had to work through.

## My Value Isn’t Their Value

I’ve come to realize that my job isn’t just different from a developer’s—it’s a different kind of valuable. My friends build products, but I build people. I’m the person who takes complex concepts and makes them simple for a beginner. I get to witness the exact moment a student finally “gets it,” and I know that I helped them get there.

The freedom I have to choose my own projects and the loyalty I get from my students are two things I wouldn’t trade. This isn’t just a job; it’s a way to empower people and change lives. That kind of impact is worth so much more than a bigger paycheck.

## My Path Is a Blend

I used to think I had to choose between being a trainer and being a developer. Now, I see that I don’t have to pick just one. I can have a career that blends both.

For me, that means exploring roles like **Developer Advocate**. In that job, I’d still get to teach and build a community, but I’d also be working with the latest tech. I could create technical content—building projects for a curriculum just like I do now—but for a larger audience on a platform like Coursera. Or, I could freelance as a developer on the side to keep my skills sharp, using that income to support my passion for creating free content for my students.

Ultimately, I’ve learned that my greatest strength is the combination of my skills. I’m not just a developer, and I’m not just a trainer—I’m both. By embracing that, I can create a career that is more rewarding and fulfilling than either path could be on its own.
