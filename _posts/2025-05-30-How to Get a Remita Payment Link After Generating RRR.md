If you've ever had to pay for government services, school fees, or corporate bills in Nigeria, you've likely come across **Remita** and something called **RRR**â€”thatâ€™s the *Remita Retrieval Reference*. But once you've generated your RRR, whatâ€™s next?

Hereâ€™s how to create a payment link that you or your customers can use to complete the payment easily.

### âœ… Step-by-Step: From RRR to Payment Link

1. **Generate your RRR**
   This can be done on the [Remita website](https://remita.net), or via any integration using the Remita API.

2. **Create your payment link**
   Use this format:

<mark>https://login.remita.net/remita/onepage/payment/init.reg?rrr={rrr}&channel=CARD,USSD,ENAIRA,TRANSFER</mark>

   Replace `{rrr}` with the actual 12-digit RRR you generated (no dashes).

3. **Example**
   Letâ€™s say your RRR is: `250008291303`

   Your payment link will look like this:


<mark>https://login.remita.net/remita/onepage/payment/init.reg?rrr=250008291303&channel=CARD,USSD,ENAIRA,TRANSFER</mark>

5. **Share the link**
   Send it to your customer, student, or client. Theyâ€™ll be able to choose their preferred payment channelâ€”**Card, USSD, eNaira, or Bank Transfer**.
