When starting a PHP project, you’ll often need to create an empty array. You might see either:

```php
$list = array();
```

or

```php
$list = [];
```

Both do the same thing—create an empty array—but which is better?

---

### ✅ The Basics

Let’s break it down:

* `$list`: A variable to hold data.
* `=`: The assignment operator.
* `[]`: Modern syntax for an empty array.
* `array()`: Traditional function-based way to create an array.

---

### 🎯 So, What’s the Difference?

* `array()` is the **old-school** way. Been around since PHP 3.
* `[]` is the **modern** shorthand, introduced in PHP 5.4.

**Both work** the same, but `[]` is cleaner and more current.

---

### 💡 Why You Should Use `[]`

* **Readability**: Shorter and clearer.
* **Modern Practice**: Aligns with current PHP standards.
* **Consistency**: Keeps your codebase neat.

### 🧪 Quick Quiz

**1. What’s the primary difference between `$list = []` and `$list = array()`?**

**(A)** `array()` creates a numeric array, `[]` creates an associative one
**(B)** `array()` is deprecated
**(C)** Both are functionally the same, but `[]` is newer syntax ✅
**(D)** `[]` is faster than `array()`

---

**2. Which syntax is recommended in modern PHP and why?**

**(A)** `array()`—it's traditional
**(B)** `[]`—concise, modern, readable ✅
**(C)** Either—no performance difference
**(D)** `array()`—more compatible with old versions

---

### 👨‍💻 Final Word

While both forms work, modern PHP developers prefer:

```php
$list = [];
```

It's cleaner, more readable, and fits today’s best practices. If you're still using `array()`, it's time for an upgrade.
