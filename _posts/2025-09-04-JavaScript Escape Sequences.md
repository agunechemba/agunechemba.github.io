# JavaScript Escape Sequences: Talking in Secret Codes

Have you ever wanted to sneak a secret message into a note so that only your best friend understands it? You might use little symbols, shortcuts, or special codes.
That’s what **escape sequences** in JavaScript are: **special codes inside strings** that let you write characters that are otherwise hard or impossible to type directly.

### **What is an Escape Sequence?**

In JavaScript, an **escape sequence** starts with a **backslash `\`** followed by a character.
This tells JavaScript: *“Hey! Don’t take this literally. It means something special.”*

Example:

```
let message = "Hello\nWorld!";
console.log(message);
```

Output:

```
Hello
World!
```

Here, `\n` means **new line**.

### **Why Do We Need Escape Sequences?**

Because sometimes we want to:

* Add invisible formatting like **new lines** or **tabs**.
* Show characters that normally **confuse the code**, like quotes (`"`) or a backslash (`\`).
* Represent characters that don’t have a direct keyboard key.

### **Common Escape Sequences**

* `\n` → New line (like pressing "Enter")
* `\t` → Tab space (like pressing "Tab")
* `\"` → Double quote inside a string
* `\'` → Single quote inside a string
* `\\` → Backslash itself
* `\uXXXX` → Unicode character (special symbols like emojis)

Example:

```
let quote = "She said, \"JavaScript is fun!\"";
console.log(quote);
// Output: She said, "JavaScript is fun!"
```

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of escape sequences like **stage directions in a play script**.
Actors don’t say them out loud, but they control what happens:

* `\n` is like saying: (move to a new line)
* `\t` is like saying: (add a space before speaking)
* `\"` is like saying: (show a quote mark without ending the dialogue)

They aren’t visible in the final performance, but they **shape how the dialogue looks**.

### **In Short**

Escape sequences are **special codes inside strings** that help you write things like new lines, tabs, quotes, or even emojis that wouldn’t work normally.

#### **Review Questions**

1. Escape sequences in JavaScript always start with a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. The escape sequence `\n` means \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. To add a tab space, we use the escape sequence \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. To include a double quote inside a string, we write \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
5. To include a single quote inside a string, we write \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
6. To display a backslash itself, we write \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
7. Escape sequences are useful for adding invisible formatting like new lines and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
8. Unicode escape sequences start with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ followed by four digits.
9. Escape sequences can be thought of like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ directions in a play.
10. The output of `"Hello\nWorld!"` will appear on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ lines.
