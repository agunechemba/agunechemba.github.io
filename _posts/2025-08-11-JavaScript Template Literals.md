# JavaScript Template Literals: Strings with Superpowers

Imagine you‚Äôre typing a WhatsApp message. You don‚Äôt just want to send plain text‚Äîyou might want to drop in an emoji üòä, the current time, or even your friend‚Äôs name automatically. That‚Äôs exactly what **Template Literals** do for strings in JavaScript‚Äîthey make them smarter, prettier, and a lot easier to work with.

### So‚Ä¶ what are Template Literals?

Normally, you wrap strings in **single quotes** (`'Hello'`) or **double quotes** (`"Hello"`).
Template Literals use **backticks** instead:

```
`Hello World`
```

Those little slanted ticks (`` ` ``) aren‚Äôt just for decoration‚Äîthey unlock a whole set of new powers.

### **Power #1 ‚Äî Multiline Strings (Goodbye \n)**

With regular strings, if you want text on multiple lines, you have to use the `\n` character:

```
"Hello\nWorld"
```

But Template Literals let you press **Enter** right inside the quotes:

```
const message = `Game Over!
John's score was 740.`;

console.log(message);
```

No weird symbols‚Äîjust clean, readable text, exactly how it will appear.

### **Power #2 ‚Äî String Interpolation (Magic Insertion)**

Say you have a player‚Äôs name stored in a variable:

```
const name = "John";
const score = 74;
```

With old-school strings, you‚Äôd write:

```
"Hello " + name + "! Your score: " + score
```

With Template Literals, you can **embed** variables or even calculations inside `${ }`:

```
console.log(`Game Over!
${name}'s score was ${score * 10}.`);
```

JavaScript replaces `${name}` with the value of `name`, and `${score * 10}` with the calculated result‚Äîright inside the string.

### **Power #3 ‚Äî Tagged Templates (The Expert‚Äôs Tool)**

Here‚Äôs where it gets fancy. You can put a **function name** right before the backtick. This ‚Äútag function‚Äù gets the string‚Äôs **static parts** and the **inserted values** separately.

For example:

```
function customTag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Static parts
  console.log(values);  // Inserted values
}

customTag`Hello ${name}, score: ${score}`;
```

Why is this useful? Because you can filter, format, or even transform the output into something completely different‚Äîlike secure HTML, formatted currency, or database queries.

### **Power #4 ‚Äî Raw Strings**

Normally, `\n` means ‚Äúnew line.‚Äù But what if you want JavaScript to treat it literally as `\n`?

```
console.log(String.raw`Line1\nLine2`);
// Output: Line1\nLine2
```

`String.raw` keeps every backslash and special character exactly as typed‚Äîperfect for regex patterns or file paths.

---

### **Power #5 ‚Äî Building HTML with Ease**

Because Template Literals can handle multiline text and variable embedding, they‚Äôre perfect for generating HTML:

```
const username = "Alex";
const html = `
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome, ${username}!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```

Combine them with a tag function that escapes unsafe characters, and you‚Äôve got safe, dynamic HTML generation without messy concatenation.

## Fill-in-the-Blank Practice

1. Template Literals are written using **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** instead of single or double quotes.
2. You can insert variables into a Template Literal using the syntax **\${\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_}**.
3. The ability to insert variables or expressions directly into strings is called **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.
4. In Template Literals, pressing **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** inside the string automatically creates a new line without `\n`.
5. A **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** function can be placed before a Template Literal to process its content before it becomes a final string.
6. The `String.________` method returns the raw text of a Template Literal, ignoring escape sequences like `\n`.
7. `${score * 10}` inside a Template Literal will first **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** the expression before placing it in the string.
8. Template Literals make it easier to create **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** text blocks without messy string concatenation.
9. In a tagged template, the first argument to the tag function is an **array of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ parts** of the string.
10. Template Literals are especially useful for building **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** content dynamically in JavaScript.
