# üåà Google Apps Script: Creating a Modeless Dialog in Google Docs

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-apps-script-education.jpg" width="100%">

Imagine this: you‚Äôre working on a Google Doc, and your Add-on opens a little helper window ‚Äî maybe it gives tips, or shows shortcuts, or even allows you to insert snippets of text as you type.
You wouldn‚Äôt want that window to freeze your document, right? You‚Äôd want to keep typing, scrolling, and editing while the helper floats nearby.

That‚Äôs exactly what a **modeless dialog** is built for.

Unlike the **modal dialog**, which locks the screen and demands your attention, the **modeless dialog** politely stays open in the corner ‚Äî you can click, type, or edit your document while it quietly waits for your next move.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Update the Script

We‚Äôll make just one tiny change to the code you wrote for the modal dialog.
Here‚Äôs the updated function:

```javascript
function showDialog() {
  var html = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index');
  DocumentApp.getUi().showModelessDialog(html, 'Greeting');
}
```

Did you notice the difference?
We simply replaced **`showModalDialog`** with **`showModelessDialog`**.
That one small change makes a big difference in how the dialog behaves.

## üß† Step 2: Understanding What‚Äôs Happening

Here‚Äôs what the code does, line by line:

* The first line creates a variable named `html` that loads your HTML file ‚Äî in this case, `Index.html`.
* The next line calls the `showModelessDialog()` method, which displays the content in a floating dialog box.

But here‚Äôs the key distinction:

* A **modal** dialog *locks* your document ‚Äî you can‚Äôt click or type until it‚Äôs closed.
* A **modeless** dialog *floats* above your document, allowing you to keep working freely.

It‚Äôs like a sticky note pinned to your workspace ‚Äî always visible, but never in your way.

## üíª Step 3: Test Your Modeless Dialog

Let‚Äôs bring it to life!

1. Save your script changes.
2. Run `onOpen()` or reload your Google Doc.
3. Go to **Add-ons ‚Üí Chapter 2 ‚Üí Show Dialog.**

You‚Äôll now see your dialog appear just like before, but this time, notice how you can:

* Click inside your document.
* Type new text.
* Even drag the dialog around the screen.

That‚Äôs the **modeless** behavior in action! You get your mini-interface and your full document control ‚Äî both at the same time.

## üé® Step 4: When to Use Modeless Dialogs

Modeless dialogs are perfect when you want your Add-on to assist the user continuously without blocking their workflow.
Think of it as a sidekick instead of a supervisor.

Use a modeless dialog for:

* Real-time tools (like word counters, translators, or note helpers)
* Forms that users fill while editing text
* Live feedback windows or hint panels
* In-document guides or floating tool palettes

---

## ‚ú® Bonus: Keep It Pretty and Functional

You can use the same `Index.html` you built earlier. Add styles or controls as you wish!
You might, for example, include a button to close the dialog when it‚Äôs no longer needed:

```html
<button onclick="google.script.host.close()">Close Dialog</button>
```

Or go fancy with a minimalist interface that feels like part of the editor itself ‚Äî that‚Äôs the beauty of HTML customization inside Google Apps Script.

---

## üí° The Big Picture

By now, you‚Äôve built **three user interface types** in Google Apps Script:

1. **Sidebar** ‚Äî docks neatly on the right, great for long-term panels.
2. **Modal Dialog** ‚Äî locks the document until dismissed, best for alerts or confirmations.
3. **Modeless Dialog** ‚Äî floats freely, lets users multitask, ideal for tools and assistants.

With these three, you can design just about any kind of interactive Add-on experience you dream up.
