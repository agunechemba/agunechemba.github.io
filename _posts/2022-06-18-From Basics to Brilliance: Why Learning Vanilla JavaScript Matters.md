Jumping straight into flashy frameworks is tempting. React, Vue, Angular—they’re cool and get things done fast. But skipping JavaScript basics? That’s a rookie mistake.

Think about Ruby or PHP: we start with core language skills before diving into Rails or Laravel. Why not do the same with JavaScript?

**Why Learn Vanilla JavaScript First?**

1. **Sharpen Problem-Solving:** Knowing the core language helps you debug faster and write cleaner, smarter code.

2. **Write Better Code:** Mastering fundamentals means your code is readable, maintainable, and easier for teams to work on.

3. **Stay Flexible:** When you know JS well, you can jump between frameworks without getting lost. That makes you way more versatile.

**Bottom line?** Learn the vanilla stuff first. It’s the foundation that’ll make everything else click. You’ll code smarter, not just faster, and handle any new tool that comes your way.
