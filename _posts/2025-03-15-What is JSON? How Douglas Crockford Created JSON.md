Back in 2001, Douglas Crockford was working on a project that needed a better way to send data between computers over the internet. At the time, developers used XML — a bulky and complex format.

But Crockford thought: “There has to be a simpler way.”

## 💡 The Big Idea

While working with JavaScript, Crockford realized that the language already had a built-in way of organizing data — using objects! What if we could use that format to exchange data between systems?

So he began working on a solution. He took inspiration from other languages like Python and Perl, simplified the structure, and created something that was:

* Easy to read and write
* Lightweight
* Perfect for JavaScript (and later, other languages too)

 He called it JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.

## 📦 What Does JSON Look Like?

Here’s a very simple example of JSON:
```
{
"name": "Douglas Crockford",
"created": "JSON",
"year": 2001,
"isAwesome": true
}
```
This looks a lot like a JavaScript object. And that was the whole point — it’s easy for both humans and computers to understand.

## 🧠 JSON in Action (with Code)

Here’s a basic JavaScript example showing how JSON works:
```
// A sample JSON string
const jsonString = '{"name": "Ada", "age": 12, "isStudent": true}';

// Parse JSON to turn it into a JavaScript object
const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(data.name);       // Output: Ada
console.log(data.age);        // Output: 12
console.log(data.isStudent);  // Output: true

// Convert JavaScript object to JSON
const newJson = JSON.stringify(data);

console.log(newJson);
// Output: {"name":"Ada","age":12,"isStudent"\:true}
```

## 🌍 Why JSON Matters Today

JSON quickly became popular. Developers loved it. It was faster than XML, easier to read, and perfect for web applications.

Today, JSON is everywhere — powering APIs, databases, mobile apps, and websites. From small hobby projects to giant tech platforms, JSON plays a key role in how computers talk to each other.

## 🎉 The Accidental Genius

Crockford didn’t set out to revolutionize the internet. He was simply solving a problem. But that small idea turned into something massive — and changed the way data flows online.

And that’s the story of how a small JavaScript insight became a big deal.

## Review Questions

Sure! Here are 5 practical review questions based on the blog:

1. Who created JSON, and what problem was he trying to solve?

2. What are three advantages of JSON compared to XML?

3. Look at this JSON string:
```
{"city": "Lagos", "population": 21000000, "isCapital": false}
```
What is the value of the key "isCapital"?

4. What does JSON.parse() do in JavaScript, and why is it useful?

5. Write a JavaScript object and convert it into a JSON string using JSON.stringify().
