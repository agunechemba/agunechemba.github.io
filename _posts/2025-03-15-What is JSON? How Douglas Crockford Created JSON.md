In 2001, Douglas Crockford was working on a project. He needed to find a way to share data between different computers on the internet. At that time, people used big and complicated formats like XML.

Crockford wanted something simpler. One day, he had an idea. He realized that the JavaScript programming language could be used to share data easily.

Crockford started working on his idea. He made it simpler and easier to use. He took ideas from other programming languages like Python and Perl.

As Crockford worked on his project, he found that his new format was better than XML. It was shorter, easier to read and write, and faster to use.

Crockford named his new format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It quickly became popular among web developers. They liked it because it was simple and easy to use.

Today, JSON is used by many websites and applications. It’s an important part of the internet.

Crockford’s creation of JSON was an accident. He was trying to solve a problem and found something new. His simple idea changed the way people share data on the internet.
