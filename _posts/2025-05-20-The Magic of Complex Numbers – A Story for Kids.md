# 🌟 The Magic of Complex Numbers – A Story for Kids

![Ekene Agunechemba](https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a_funny_yoruba_boy_named_tobi_in.jpeg)

One day, a boy named **Tobi** discovered a magical number in his computer class. It wasn’t just any number — it was a **complex number**. This number had two special parts: a **real part** (just like normal numbers we use every day) and an **imaginary part** (a little magical twist!).

Tobi typed this into his computer:

```python
magic_number = 2 + 3j
```

He asked his teacher, “What’s this **3j**?”

His teacher smiled and said, “The **2** is your regular number — it’s real. But the **3j** is imaginary. It’s like adding a sprinkle of magic to the number. That’s why we call it a **complex number** — because it’s made of two parts.”

Tobi was curious. He asked, “Can I make this number in another way?”

“Yes!” the teacher said. “Try this:

```python
magic_number = complex(2, 3)
```

That gives you the same magical number!”

Then Tobi wanted to see the two parts separately. So he asked the computer:

```python
magic_number.real
```

The computer replied: `2.0`. “That’s the real part!” Tobi shouted.

Next, he tried:

```python
magic_number.imag
```

The computer answered: `3.0`. “That’s the imaginary part — the magic!”

Finally, Tobi wondered, “What kind of number is this really?”

So he asked:

```python
type(magic_number)
```

And the computer said: `<class 'complex'>`

Tobi grinned. “Now I know! Complex numbers are like a mix of real life and a bit of magic. Just like me!”
