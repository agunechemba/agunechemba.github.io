Many mistake friendship for partnership. But success demands results, not emotion. Your friends might lack the skill or drive. Yet out of loyalty, you tolerate mediocrity. That’s how businesses fail and relationships sour.

Friendship runs on emotion. Work runs on execution. Mixing both carelessly ruins both. Keep friends for life. Hire for results. Sentiment is for memory. Success is for the competent. Power flows to the one who delivers.


## Google Founders Hiring Eric Schmidt

Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not only brilliant minds, but they were also close collaborators, visionaries who turned a Stanford project into the world’s most powerful search engine.
But here’s what separates genius from mastery: They knew when to let go.

As Google exploded in scale, the chaos of rapid growth demanded executive experience beyond their comfort zone. So in 2001, they made a cold, calculated move: They hired Eric Schmidt, an outsider, experienced and more corporate, with decades of executive leadership from Sun Microsystems and Novell. This wasn’t about chemistry or friendship. It was about competence.

They understood that Google's future success depended on bringing in someone with proven, high-level executive competence, even if it meant relinquishing the CEO title themselves.

Had they prioritized emotions over outcomes, they might have handed the reins to a loyal friend or early team member. But that could’ve easily turned Google into another dot-com casualty of the early 2000s. Instead, they showed strategic detachment.
Friendship is not a qualification. Results are.

**How to Implement This:**
- Set standards, not stories: Don’t care who it is. If they can't meet the standard, they don't belong in that role.

- Separate sentiment from structure: Friendship is not a qualification. Loyalty is not a skill. Competence is king.

- Make outcomes visible and trackable: Don’t evaluate people based on how much you like them. Evaluate by: Did they get it done, On time or With quality?

- Practice surgical detachment: You can love someone and still remove them from your mission. That is power. That is clarity.

- Let your emotions fuel your vision, not cloud your decisions: Emotion gives fire. Logic gives aim. You need both, but never confuse them.

Success doesn’t come from keeping everyone happy, it comes from making strategic, sometimes uncomfortable decisions that serve your vision. The greatest leaders in history didn’t play it safe or sentimental, they played to win.
