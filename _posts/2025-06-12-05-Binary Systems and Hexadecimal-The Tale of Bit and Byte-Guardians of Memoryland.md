# 05-Binary Systems and Hexadecimal: The Tale of Bit and Byte; Guardians of Memoryland

Once upon a techie time, in the kingdom of **Binary**, lived a tiny creature named **Bit**. Bit was the smallest thing you could imagine—it could only be **on (1)** or **off (0)**. Not very exciting, huh? Bit was like a light switch: it either lit up or stayed dark.

But Bit wasn’t alone for long! He made some friends, and when **8 Bits** got together, they became something bigger and better: **BYTE**! Byte was like the superhero of Binary Kingdom. He could store one letter—just one, like "A" or "B". Pretty cool, right? 📦✨

As time went on, Byte realized that even **he** wasn’t enough to store songs, pictures, or games. So Byte called a meeting, and soon, thousands of Bytes came together to form **Kilobyte**, then **Megabyte**, then **Gigabyte**, and even **Terabyte**—huge memory warriors! 🦸‍♂️💾🦸‍♀️

Here’s their secret power scale—based on the magic of **powers of 2**:

| Memory Unit         | Size in Bytes               | Power of 2 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| **1 KB** (Kilobyte) | 1,024 bytes                 | 2¹⁰        |
| **1 MB** (Megabyte) | 1,048,576 bytes             | 2²⁰        |
| **1 GB** (Gigabyte) | 1,073,741,824 bytes         | 2³⁰        |
| **1 TB** (Terabyte) | 1,099,511,627,776 bytes     | 2⁴⁰        |
| **1 PB** (Petabyte) | 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes | 2⁵⁰        |

Yup, those numbers are HUGE. Like, you’d need a calculator just to say them out loud 😅.

### 🧊 But Wait… Enemies Appear!

There was trouble in Binary Kingdom. From the land of **Decimal**, another army arrived—these guys measured memory in **powers of 10**.

They claimed:

* 1 KB = 1,000 bytes
* 1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes
* 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes

Hold up, that’s NOT what the binary crew believed! 😠💥

To keep peace in the kingdom, a wise council called the **IEC** created **new names** for the binary heroes. Now, instead of Kilobyte (KB), they used:

* **KiB** = Kibibyte = 1,024 bytes
* **MiB** = Mebibyte = 1,048,576 bytes
* **GiB** = Gibibyte = 1,073,741,824 bytes
* **TiB** = Tebibyte = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes

But let's be real—not everyone listens to the IEC. So most people (including your textbooks and exams) still call them KB, MB, GB, and so on—even when they **actually mean the binary versions**. Confusing? Kinda. But you'll get used to it. Just remember: **Context is king**.

### 📱 Everyday Magic: How Big Is Your Memory?

Let’s talk real life. Here’s how these memory units help you:

* A movie might be **1 GB** in size.
* Your phone camera pictures? Each photo could be **4 MB**.
* If your hard drive is **2 TB**, that means you can save like **500,000 photos**! 📸📸📸📸📸

Also, when your internet speed is **32 megabits per second (Mbps)**, that’s really **4 megabytes per second (MB/s)**—because there are **8 bits in a byte** (bit gang still running strong!). So, a **40 MB file** would take **10 seconds** to download. Fast, right?
