## 🌿 A Peaceful Pause from Code

As a tech trainer, my days are filled with code, commands, and logic puzzles. But sometimes, I step away from the screen to reconnect with something slower, quieter, and deeper.

The **Tao Te Ching By-Laozi** is an ancient book full of calm wisdom—and I’ve retold all 81 chapters as short, simple stories for kids (and grown-ups too). It's not about tech, but it speaks to the heart of good teaching, clear thinking, and gentle living.

Take a break from the fast-paced digital world, and enjoy these timeless lessons—one story at a time. 🧘‍♂️💻
