# Google Slide Project: The Interactive Museum Guide

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/the-interactive-museum-guide.jpg" with="100%">

**Project Goal:** Design and build an interactive, non-linear museum guide for a fictional museum called the **"Institute of Future History."** The guide will be a standalone Google Slides presentation that can be navigated by a user without a presenter.

This project goes beyond simple slide transitions and animations. It requires deep knowledge of linking, embedding, and creative design to create a seamless, interactive experience.

### Core Requirements & Advanced Techniques

Your final presentation must effectively use the following features:

**1. Hyperlinking & Non-Linear Navigation:**

* **Slide-to-Slide Navigation:** The user must be able to click on different exhibits from a main "floor plan" or "gallery" slide to jump directly to a specific exhibit slide.
* **External Links:** Include at least three links to external websites that provide "more information" about the exhibits (e.g., a link to a Wikipedia page about a specific historical event or a video).
* **Internal Navigation:** Each exhibit slide must have a "back" button or link that takes the user directly back to the main gallery slide.
* **Creative Linking:** Think beyond simple text. Link shapes, images, or even parts of an image to different slides.

**2. Animations & Transitions:**

* **Object Animations:** Use a combination of **animations on click** and **animations after previous** to reveal information on an exhibit slide. For example, have text and images fade in one by one as the user clicks through the details of an artifact.
* **Subtle Transitions:** Use subtle transitions like **"Fade"** or **"Dissolve"** between slides to create a smooth, professional feel. Avoid flashy or distracting transitions.
* **Advanced Animation Timing:** Use the animation pane to set precise timing and order for objects to appear, creating a choreographed reveal of information.

**3. Advanced Media & Embedding:**

* **Embedded YouTube Videos:** Embed at least two YouTube videos that play directly within the presentation to provide more context for the exhibits. The videos should be set to auto-play or on click, and you must format them so they fit seamlessly into your design.
* **Audio Integration:** While Google Slides doesn't have a native "audio" button, you can insert a Google Drive audio file and set it to play automatically or on click to add background music or sound effects to a specific slide.
* **Masking & Cropping:** Use the image-cropping tools and shape-masking features to creatively frame images and videos to fit your design aesthetic.

**4. Design & Layout Mastery:**

* **Custom Theme & Master Slides:** Create a custom theme with a consistent color palette, fonts, and a unique background. Use **Master Slides** to define the layout for your exhibit slides, ensuring every slide maintains a consistent look and feel without manual adjustments.
* **Shape Manipulation:** Use the shape tools to create custom buttons, icons, or graphical elements that match your theme. Utilize the **"Group"** and **"Arrange"** functions to keep elements organized and easy to move.
* **Transparent PNGs & GIFs:** Use transparent images (PNGs) to layer elements and create a sense of depth. You could also include a simple, well-placed GIF for a bit of motion.

### Project Execution Steps

1.  **Define Your Exhibits:**
    * Choose a theme for your "Future History" museum. Examples: "The Rise of AI," "Humanity's Journey to Mars," or "Everyday Tech of the 22nd Century."
    * Create a list of 5-7 "exhibits" (e.g., "The First Martian Colony Rover," "A Holo-Tablet from 2150," "Neural Interface Prototypes").

2.  **Create Your Master Slides:**
    * Design the core layout for your exhibits. This is where you'll define the "look" of your guide. Include placeholders for titles, images, and text.
    * Create a unique master slide for your main "gallery" or "floor plan" slide.

3.  **Build Your Main Gallery Slide:**
    * Design a visual map or layout where the user can click on different areas to go to each exhibit. Use shapes and images as the clickable links.

4.  **Populate Your Exhibit Slides:**
    * Use the layouts you created in the Master Slides.
    * Add images, text, and embedded media (videos, audio) for each exhibit.
    * Apply the animations and transitions you planned.

5.  **Test & Refine:**
    * Run the presentation in "Present" mode.
    * Click through all the links to ensure they work correctly.
    * Check that all media plays as intended and that the animations are timed perfectly.
    * Share the project with a friend or colleague and ask them to navigate it to see if the experience is intuitive.

This project offers a significant challenge that goes beyond what most users do with Google Slides, forcing you to think about the presentation as a piece of interactive software rather than a linear narrative. Good luck!
