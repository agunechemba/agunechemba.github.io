### 🧠 **Meet CPU, Input & Output**

Once upon a time in a bright and cheerful classroom, something exciting was about to happen. The teacher, Mr. Smart, walked in with a big smile and said:

> “Class, I have a puzzle for you!”

Everyone looked around, curious. But in this class, only one person was allowed to solve puzzles—the quiet and brainy student named **CPU**.

CPU wasn’t alone, though. He had two helpful friends:

* **Input**, also called *Receiver*, and
* **Output**, lovingly known as *Giver*.

These three worked as a team. Let’s see how.

### 🎯 **The Puzzle Challenge**

Mr. Smart whispered the puzzle to **Input (Receiver)**. Input listened carefully, then rushed over to CPU.

> “Here’s the puzzle,” Input said, whispering in CPU’s ear.

CPU closed his eyes, tapped his fingers, and began to think. That’s what he was best at—**processing information**.

After a few seconds, CPU smiled. He had the answer. But remember, he never said it out loud.

So, CPU turned to **Output (Giver)** and whispered the answer.

With a huge grin, Output jumped up and announced:

> “The answer is 42!”

The class clapped. Mr. Smart smiled. The puzzle was solved—thanks to teamwork.

### 💡 **Lesson Behind the Story**

This story is just like how a **computer works**.

* **Input devices** (like keyboards, mice, microphones) help the computer *receive* information.
* The **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) *processes* that information.
* **Output devices** (like monitors, printers, speakers) *deliver* the result back to us.

**Input receives → CPU thinks → Output gives.**

Simple and cool, right?
