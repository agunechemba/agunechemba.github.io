## 📚 What is NotebookLM?

At its heart, NotebookLM is designed to give you a dedicated space for **reading, thinking, asking questions, and writing**, all centered around your own material. You start by bringing in your documents, web pages, or other materials — these are called **"sources"** in NotebookLM.

### ✅ Supported source types include:
- Google Docs & Slides  
- PDFs  
- Web URLs  
- Copied text  
- YouTube URLs  
- Audio files

NotebookLM creates a **static copy** of your sources the moment you upload them, so your original files stay untouched.

## 🗂️ Meet the Notebook

Your documents get organized into a **notebook**, like folders on your computer. Once they’re inside, the magic begins.

NotebookLM immediately starts to **synthesize the information** and pull out key insights.
