##  Welcome Aboard 🚀

Imagine this: you're in a high-tech **spaceship** zooming through the internet galaxy. That **spaceship** is your **web browser**—Chrome, Firefox, Safari—you name it. 🛸

Inside that spaceship is a clever pilot: **JavaScript**. But even the smartest pilot needs a **dashboard** to control things like opening new doors, talking to passengers, checking the ship's dimensions, and warping through history.

That dashboard? It’s called the **BOM – Browser Object Model**. And today, we’re going to explore its controls like curious space cadets!

## 🌌 So, What *is* the BOM?

> The **BOM** is JavaScript's way of **interacting with the browser itself**, not just the web page.

While the **DOM** is all about the **webpage content** (like paragraphs, buttons, and images), the **BOM** is about the **browser environment**.

With the BOM, JavaScript can:

* Open or close browser **tabs/windows**
* Display **alerts**, **prompts**, or **confirmations**
* Read the screen or browser **dimensions**
* Peek into the browser’s **identity and settings**
* Travel through **browsing history**
* Set **timers** and **intervals**

## 🛠️ The BOM Toolkit: Console, Controls & Cool Tricks

Let’s take a look at the major buttons and switches JavaScript has access to on the spaceship control panel:

---

### 🪟 1. `window` – The Captain's Deck

At the heart of the BOM is the **`window` object**. It’s like the **main control room** of your browser. Nearly everything in the BOM lives inside it.

Fun fact: even things like `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `setTimeout()` are part of the `window` object.

```js
alert("Welcome aboard!");        // Same as:
window.alert("Welcome aboard!");
```

So whenever you see `window.something`, it’s just JavaScript saying, “Hey browser, I need this control.”

---

### 🌐 2. `window.open()` – Open a New Tab or Window

Want to open a new page from JavaScript? Here’s your warp gate opener:

```js
window.open("https://agunechemba.github.io");
```

Just like that—**WHOOSH!**—a new tab flies open.

---

### 📐 3. `window.innerWidth` & `window.innerHeight` – Size Up the Viewport

Ever want to check the size of your browser window's **content area**? These tools are your sensors:

```js
console.log(window.innerWidth);
console.log(window.innerHeight);
```

Perfect when designing responsive websites or adjusting elements based on screen size!

---

### 🧭 4. `navigator` – The Browser's Passport & ID Card

The `navigator` object holds **info about the browser and device**. It's like a passport JavaScript can inspect.

```js
console.log(navigator.userAgent);  // Browser identity
console.log(navigator.language);   // Language like "en-US"
```

Great for localization or browser-specific behavior!

---

### 🖥️ 5. `screen` – Monitor Radar System

Need to know the **actual screen size** (not just the browser window)? Tap into the `screen` object:

```js
console.log(screen.width);
console.log(screen.height);
```

Useful for centering popups or full-screen apps!

---

### ⏱️ 6. `setTimeout()` & `setInterval()` – JavaScript's Time Machines

Want to delay code execution or run something repeatedly? These time tools have you covered.

**Wait, then run:**

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  alert("3 seconds have passed!");
}, 3000);
```

**Run forever (until stopped):**

```js
setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Tick... Tock...");
}, 1000);
```

It’s like JavaScript setting an alarm or heartbeat function.

---

### 🧠 7. `history` – The Browser Time Travel Button

Missed a page? Want to go back to the past or zoom into the future? The `history` object lets you do just that:

```js
history.back();     // Go back one step
history.forward();  // Go forward one step
```

Your browser history becomes a **time machine** JavaScript can control. 🕰️

## 🧠 TL;DR – BOM in a Nutshell

| Feature                     | What it Does                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `window`                    | Main access point to all BOM stuff  |
| `window.open()`             | Opens a new tab or popup            |
| `innerWidth`, `innerHeight` | Get the browser’s viewport size     |
| `navigator`                 | Info about the browser and language |
| `screen`                    | Info about the user's monitor       |
| `setTimeout`, `setInterval` | Run code after delay or repeatedly  |
| `history`                   | Navigate browser history            |

## 📝 Review & Practice Time!

1. **What’s the main difference between the DOM and the BOM?**
2. **How would you write a script to open a new browser tab to `https://openai.com`?**
3. **Write a mini script that logs the user’s screen width and height.**
4. **What’s the key difference between `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`? Give an example of each.**
5. **You want to make JavaScript go one page back in browser history—what method would you use?**
