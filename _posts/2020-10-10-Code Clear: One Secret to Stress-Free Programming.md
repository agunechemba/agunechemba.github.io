Ever stared at code wondering, *“Wait... is that a lowercase ‘l’ or the number 1?”*
You're not alone — we've all been there.

### 😵‍💫 Code Confusion Is Real

When programmers use unclear variable names like `l`, `O`, `I`, or `0`, things get tricky. These characters can look *way* too similar — especially in certain fonts.

Suddenly, debugging feels more like decoding a secret message than fixing logic.

---

### 🛑 But Don’t Blame the Font

Sure, someone might suggest using a special font that makes letters and numbers easier to tell apart. But really — who wants to depend on a **font** just to read code?

---

### ✅ The Real Fix: Be Descriptive

Use **clear, meaningful names**. Instead of:

```js
let l = 5;
let O = "open";
```

Try:

```js
let lowerCaseL = 5;
let uppercaseO = "open";
```

Or better yet, choose names based on the **purpose** of the variable:

```js
let loopCounter = 5;
let doorStatus = "open";
```

### 👓 Clear Code Saves You Later

Readable code means:

* Fewer bugs
* Easier debugging
* Happier teammates
* And a *much* less frustrated future-you

---

### 🧠 Final Tip

Good code isn’t just about making it work — it’s about making it make sense.

**So, next time you name a variable, think clarity. Think kindness. Think: “Will this still make sense tomorrow?”** 👨🏽‍💻
