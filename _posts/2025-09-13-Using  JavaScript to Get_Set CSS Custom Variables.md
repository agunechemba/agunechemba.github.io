# üé® Using **JavaScript** to Get/Set CSS Custom Variables: The Magical Theme Park

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dynamic-color-wonderland_simple_compose.jpg" width="100%">

There was a **theme park** where all the rides, shops, and decorations followed a **color theme**.

* On Monday, everything glowed **blue**.
* On Tuesday, it all turned **green**.
* On Friday, the park lit up in **red**.

How did they do this magic?
They used **CSS custom variables** (also called CSS variables) that acted like **magic paint buckets**. And the park manager (JavaScript) could change the color of the whole park by just switching the bucket‚Äôs paint.

### **What are CSS Custom Variables?**

In CSS, you can define a variable (a reusable value) with two dashes (`--`).
Example:

```
:root {
  --main-color: blue;
}
```

Now `--main-color` is like a **named paint bucket**.
You can use it everywhere in your CSS:

```
body {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
}
```

### **How Does JavaScript Change It?**

JavaScript is like the park manager who says:
*"Hey, let‚Äôs change the main paint bucket color today!"*

#### **Set a CSS Variable with JavaScript**

```
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--main-color', 'green');
```

This changes `--main-color` to green. Instantly, everything using that variable updates!

#### **Get a CSS Variable with JavaScript**

```
let color = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--main-color');
console.log(color); // outputs current value, e.g., "green"
```

### **Why Is This Useful?**

* **Themes** üåô‚òÄÔ∏è ‚Üí Switch between light mode and dark mode.
* **Customization** üé® ‚Üí Let users pick their favorite colors.
* **Dynamic Styling** ‚ö° ‚Üí Change designs instantly without rewriting all CSS.

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of CSS variables as **paint buckets** labeled with names.

* The CSS decorators use these buckets to paint walls.
* JavaScript is the park manager who can swap the paint inside a bucket, instantly changing all the walls painted with it.

---

### **In Short**

* CSS variables = reusable values defined with `--`.
* JavaScript can **get** or **set** them.
* This makes styling flexible, dynamic, and super fun.
