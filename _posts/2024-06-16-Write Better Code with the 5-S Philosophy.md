# 🧠 Write Better Code with the 5-S Philosophy

![Code Philosophy](https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/phylosophy-for-coding.png?w=1024)

The **5-S philosophy**, originally from Japanese workplace practices, works wonders for coding too. Here’s how to apply it to your codebase:

---

### 1. 🗂️ **Sort**

Organize your files, folders, and code. Keep only what’s needed. Label things clearly.

---

### 2. 📌 **Set**

Every piece of code should be in the right place. If something feels out of place—refactor it.

---

### 3. ✨ **Shine**

Keep your code clean. Remove clutter, dead code, and messy comments. Make it readable.

---

### 4. 📏 **Standardize**

Follow coding conventions. Whether you're solo or in a team, stick to agreed styles and patterns.

---

### 5. 🔁 **Sustain**

Good code is a habit. Keep reviewing, refactoring, and improving over time.

---

### ✅ Final Thought

Clean code isn’t magic—it’s maintenance. Use 5-S to stay sharp and make your code a joy to read!
