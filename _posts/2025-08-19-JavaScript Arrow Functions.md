# 🚀 JavaScript Arrow Functions: The Unusual Way of Writing Functions

Imagine you’re texting a friend. Sometimes you type a **long formal message**, like:

> *“Hello, how are you doing today? I was wondering if you’d like to play football this evening.”*

But other times, you keep it **short and fast**, like:

> *“Game at 5?”*

Both messages mean the same thing, but the second one is way quicker.

That’s exactly what **arrow functions** are in JavaScript: a **shorter, faster way** to write functions.

## **The Usual Way of Writing Functions**

Normally, if you want a function, you’d write:

```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

That works fine. But JavaScript says:
👉 “Hey, want a shortcut?”

---

## **The Arrow Function Way**

The same thing can be written with an arrow (`=>`):

```
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

Much shorter, right?

## **Real Life Scenario 1: Calculator App**

Imagine you’re making a small calculator on a webpage:

```
let multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
let divide = (x, y) => x / y;

console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20
console.log(divide(10, 2));  // 5
```

Arrow functions make your code feel lighter and quicker.

## **Real Life Scenario 2: To-Do List App**

Suppose you have a list of tasks and you want to print them all:

```
let tasks = ["Homework", "Clean room", "Play football"];

tasks.forEach(task => console.log(task));
```

Here, instead of writing a long `function(task) { ... }`, you just write `task => ...`. Super neat!

## **When You Need Braces `{}`**

If your function has more than one line, you still need `{}` and `return`:

```
let greet = (name) => {
  let message = "Hello, " + name + "!";
  return message;
};

console.log(greet("Ada")); // Hello, Ada!
```

---

## **Special Rule: `this`**

Arrow functions don’t have their own `this`.

Think of it like this: a normal function has its own backpack called `this`, but arrow functions **borrow the backpack** from where they were created.

This is super helpful when working with buttons or events.

Example:

```
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
  }, 1000);
}

let p = new Person("Chidi");
// After 1 second → Hi, I'm Chidi
```

If we had used a normal function inside `setTimeout`, it would lose the name! Arrow functions save us from that confusion.

## ✅ Quick Recap

* Arrow functions are **shortcuts** for writing functions.
* `(a, b) => a + b` is the same as `function(a, b) { return a + b; }`.
* Use them for **short, simple functions**.
* They don’t have their own `this`, which makes them handy in certain cases.

## **Review Fill-in-the-Gap Questions**

1. Arrow functions are a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ way to write functions in JavaScript.
2. The symbol used for arrow functions is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. `(a, b) => a + b` is the short form of `function(a, b) { __________ }`.
4. In arrow functions, if there is only one line, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ keyword can be skipped.
5. Arrow functions do not have their own \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_; they borrow it from the parent scope.
6. A real-life example of arrow functions is printing tasks in a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ app.
7. To make an arrow function with multiple lines, you need \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and the `return` statement.
8. Arrow functions are especially useful in handling \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ like button clicks or timeouts.
9. `let multiply = (x, y) => x * y;` will return \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ when called with `(4, 5)`.
10. Arrow functions make code more \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
