# 3 Reasons I Stopped Ignoring `console.info()` (And You Should Too)

Okay, let’s be real. My developer console used to be a swamp — a chaotic mess of random `console.log()` statements. I’d dump everything in there, hoping to find clues, but usually just ended up more confused.

Then I started paying attention to `console.info()`.

### Think of it this way:

* `console.log()` is my trusty, if messy, notebook that catches *everything*.
* `console.info()` is a curated, organized sticky note — a gentle tap on the shoulder that says, *“Here’s some context you might find useful.”*

I use `console.info()` to track the big picture — data states, performance metrics, and anything that helps me understand *why* the code behaves the way it does. It made a huge difference.

### Here’s why you should use it too:

1. **Visual Clarity**
   Dev tools often highlight `console.info()` messages with a different color or icon. It’s like highlighting important bits in a textbook. Suddenly, your console isn’t just a wall of text; it’s organized.

2. **Filter Power**
   When wading through tons of logs, filtering by `console.info()` clears the noise and shows only the relevant context. That’s a game-changer.

3. **High-Level Understanding**
   Instead of dumping raw data with `console.log()`, I use `console.info()` to log key moments — like the start and end of a process, or array lengths before and after processing. It gives a bird’s-eye view, making the flow easier to understand.

Basically, `console.info()` isn’t just a fancier `console.log()`. It’s about creating *meaningful* logs — adding context, making debugging cleaner, faster, and dare I say, enjoyable.

Next time your console looks like a digital garbage dump, remember `console.info()`. It could unlock a clearer, more organized, and more *human* understanding of your code.
