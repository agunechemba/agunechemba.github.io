# 🕒 Understanding JavaScript Timestamps: The Tale of Tocky the Timekeeper

<img src="https://agunechembaekene.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/an_old_wrist_watch_worn_by_an.jpg" width="100%">

**Once upon a code...**

In the bustling digital city of **Browserville**, lived a tiny but mighty character named **Tocky the Timekeeper**. 🧙‍♂️⌛

Tocky had a superpower: he could **track time so precisely** that he became the official time wizard for every JavaScript program in the land! Whether it was a new game starting, an animation dancing across the screen, or a race between two buttons, Tocky was there — stopwatch in hand — ready to count **every tick**.

## 🕰️ The Two Magical Clocks

Tocky used two magical time-tracking tools:

### 1. **The Old Clock** – Low-Resolution Timestamp

Tocky’s first clock was a bit like your grandpa's wristwatch — simple, steady, and always counting milliseconds since a very special birthday: **January 1st, 1970**. 🎂
(That’s when time began for computers — no kidding!)

To check the time on this clock, Tocky would say:

```js
Date.now()
```

And boom! A number like `1461069314000` would pop up — telling him exactly how many **milliseconds** had passed since that 1970 birthday.

> "That’s a LOT of milliseconds!" chuckled Tocky.

But what if you don’t want milliseconds? What if you want the time in **seconds**? No problem! Tocky had a math trick up his sleeve:

```js
Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
```

“Divide by 1000,” he explained to the young coders of Browserville, “and you’ll turn those tiny milliseconds into full-grown seconds!”

> 🧮 Remember: 1000 milliseconds = 1 second!

### 2. **The Stopwatch of Precision** – High-Resolution Timestamp

Now Tocky’s second tool was for **serious speed tracking**. Imagine you’ve just opened a game, and you want to know **exactly** how long it's been running — down to **microseconds** (that’s millionths of a second 😲).

For that, Tocky used his shiny **Stopwatch of Precision**, known as:

```js
performance.now()
```

> "This stopwatch doesn’t care about 1970,” Tocky said. “It starts counting from the moment your game or website opens!”

So if your game started **6,288 milliseconds and 319 microseconds ago**, `performance.now()` would give you:

```js
6288.319
```

> “Perfect for smooth animations and race timers!” Tocky grinned.

## 🖥️ What If You Have an Old Browser?

One day, Tocky met a computer from the ancient village of **Internet Explorer**. It didn’t understand `Date.now()`. Oh no!

But Tocky wasn’t worried. He had a **backup spell**:

```js
(new Date()).getTime()
```

> “It works just the same,” said Tocky, patting the old machine. “A bit slower, maybe — but still strong!”

## 💡 Tocky’s Top Tips:

* Use `Date.now()` for regular, everyday time tracking.
* Use `performance.now()` when you need **super precise** timing (like for animations or measuring performance).
* Use `(new Date()).getTime()` if you're coding for older browsers.

## 🧠 Review Time with Tocky!

Let’s see how much you remember from this time-traveling tale!

### 🧩 Practice Questions:

1. **What magical date does `Date.now()` start counting from?**
2. **How many milliseconds make up one second?**
3. **Which method gives you more precise timing: `Date.now()` or `performance.now()`?**
4. **How can you get the current time in seconds using `Date.now()`?**
5. **What can you use instead of `Date.now()` on old browsers?**
