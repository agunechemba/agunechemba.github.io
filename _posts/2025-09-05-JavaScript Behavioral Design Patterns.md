### **Imagine a Play with Many Actors**

Think of a big stage play. Each actor has their own role, but they need to **interact smoothly** so the story makes sense.
Behavioral design patterns are like **scripts and rules** that guide how objects (actors) talk to each other, share responsibilities, and react to situations.

### **What are Behavioral Design Patterns?**

They are coding techniques that focus on **communication between objects**‚Äîhow they interact, make decisions, and delegate tasks.
Instead of worrying about how things are built (structure) or created (creational), behavioral patterns are about **how things behave together**.

### **Why do we need them?**

Without patterns, your code is like a messy group project where:

* Everyone shouts at once (confusing interactions).
* Some people do too much work, while others do nothing.
* It‚Äôs hard to reuse or maintain the system.

Behavioral patterns **bring order**, making sure everyone knows their role.

### **Examples of Behavioral Design Patterns**

#### 1. **Observer Pattern** üëÄ

Imagine YouTube subscriptions.

* You (the user) subscribe to a channel.
* When the channel uploads a video, **all subscribers get notified**.
* In code: one object (the subject) notifies many others (observers).

---

#### 2. **Strategy Pattern** üéØ

Think about playing a video game with multiple difficulty modes.

* Easy, Normal, Hard are different **strategies**.
* You can switch strategies without changing the entire game.
* In code: you can swap algorithms or methods depending on the situation.

---

#### 3. **Command Pattern** üïπÔ∏è

Imagine using a TV remote.

* Each button (command) tells the TV what to do: turn on, increase volume, change channel.
* The remote doesn‚Äôt care *how* the TV works inside, it just sends commands.
* In code: separate the object that issues requests from the one that executes them.

---

#### 4. **Iterator Pattern** üîÑ

Think about browsing songs on Spotify.

* You click **next** to go through the playlist one by one.
* You don‚Äôt care how the playlist is stored, you just move through items easily.
* In code: provides a way to access items in a collection without knowing its internal details.

---

### **In Short**

Behavioral patterns = **rules for smooth teamwork between objects**.
They make programs:

* Easier to maintain
* Easier to extend
* Easier to understand

### **Review Questions**

1. Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with each other.
2. The Observer pattern is like a YouTube channel notifying its \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. The Strategy pattern allows us to switch between different \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for solving a problem.
4. In the Command pattern, the remote control sends \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the TV.
5. The Iterator pattern lets us go through items one by one without knowing the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ details.
6. Behavioral patterns make programs easier to maintain, extend, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
7. The Observer pattern has two main parts: the subject and the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
8. The Strategy pattern is useful when we want to choose different \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at runtime.
9. In the Command pattern, the sender is separated from the object that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the command.
10. A playlist that lets you move through songs one by one is an example of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ pattern.
