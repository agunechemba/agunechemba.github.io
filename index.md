# About Me
***The Celebrated Tech Trainer***
---

I've been geeking out about tech education for over 15 years, and my favorite thing is helping young minds around the world discover their inner coder!

I've had the blast teaching online to students from Nigeria to the UK, and even threw some epic coding competitions in Lagos. Plus, I love sharing tech tips and tricks in my blogs
